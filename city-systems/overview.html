                <h2>A Day in the Life <em>Improving City Services</em></h2>
                <p><em>“You work for Public Lighting? Let me ask you something…”</em></p>
                <p>Demarco used to dread this moment at social gatherings. But in the last year or so, he has had many more answers for the questions that come his way. Instead of trying to provide exactly the same services to the entire city, his department has joined other city departments in a more strategic approach. Public Lighting now bases its upgrades and service decisions on real conditions and needs in each neighborhood. Maintenance schedules have been adjusted, too. As lighting strategies have improved this past year, so has public safety.</p>
                <p>This strategy is also working for Demarco on a personal level. His neighborhood, which has had a lot of vacancy and safety problems because many lights had stopped working, is getting new installation of high-efficiency streetlights and is beginning to see a quicker response to other service requests, as well as a significant drop in car break-ins at night. The investment for physical infrastructure is coordinated with other investments in the city, too. For example, renovation of the local elementary school was timed with street improvements and tree plantings. The persistent flooding in Demarco’s neighborhood is also being addressed, through a system of attractive marshlike “swales” beside the streets that collect stormwater runoff from Demarco’s neighborhood and connect to a broader system of boulevards with long, linear stormwater gardens and new tree plantings. An unexpected benefit of this change? Aquatic birds and other small native wildlife have found a refuge in parts of the neighborhood. Now if only Demarco can solve his trash pick-up problem: getting his sons to remember the trash schedule as well as the city does.</p>

                <h2>City Systems and the Environment</h2>
                <p><strong>RENEWING AND REALIGNING FOR THE NEW DETROIT.</strong> From streetlights and utility networks to waste management and transportation, Detroit’s city systems sustain its residents and businesses—but in turn must be sustained by revenues from these users. Yet population and employment loss, and the resulting loss of revenue and disinvestment, have left Detroiters paying more for less.</p>
                <p>Even though Detroit’s economy is growing in new sectors—such as information technology, finance, communications, and design—the city will likely continue to lose some population over the next 20 years. Reorganizing the city’s systems now is critical to meeting the needs of Detroiters who have been paying and waiting for a better day, as well to match and support the future Detroit of connected, diverse neighborhoods and employment centers that encourage new jobs and new neighbors. The city’s government, private utility operators, civic and business leaders, and residents face big decisions about improving services while reducing costs, closing an overwhelming budget gap that has burdened the city for decades, and reshaping an over-scaled, underinvested infrastructure into an efficient, environmentally sustainable set of 21st century systems. <strong>If we confront these tough decisions now, we can improve the quality of life for Detroiters and put the city back on the path to financial security within 10 years.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>RECONCILING AND REPLENISHING.</strong> Realigning Detroit’s city systems is not just important for the sake of efficiency: It is a matter of justice for all. The most economically vulnerable households in Detroit are also the hardest hit by system inefficiencies that harm their health as well as their pocketbooks. In particular, air pollution from industry and car exhaust have contributed to high rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases, especially among children.</p>
                <p>Transportation holds an important key to creating a socially and economically just Detroit. The Detroit of today is a driver’s city, without enough transit or other transportation choices, and with many jobs well beyond the city limits. The very people who need jobs most are left behind, struggling with transit routes that don’t connect them to work, or sharing an old car along with all the upkeep. Detroiters who can’t afford a car are also cut off from fair access to healthy food, recreation, health care, and a whole range of necessities for a healthy, balanced life.</p>
                <p>The urgency of addressing environmental degradation and residents’ quality of life reaches far beyond city limits. Regional economies, transportation, and water and air quality issues connect Detroit to the entire Great Lakes ecosystem. Traditional infrastructures and industry tend to degrade resources, with regional consequences. <strong>New alternative forms of infrastructure, using landscape to clean air and water, can restore environmental balance and improve quality of life and the environment in Detroit and in the entire Great Lakes basin.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>SHAPING THE CITY TO SUIT REAL NEEDS.</strong> The Detroit we now live in was designed for nearly 2 million people, and the extra capacity in city systems is not only going to waste, it actually creates a drag on services for the current residents. Just as we can find new ways to manage the abundance of land in the city, we can unlock innovations to manage surplus system capacity and reallocate resources to upgrade and maintain core systems, improve service, and heal the environment. Systems renewal will be coordinated with land use change to better relate neighborhoods and employment districts, as well as the systems that serve them.</p>
                <p><strong>The key is to be smart about how and where we locate and reinforce residential areas, employment, and other activities.</strong> These decisions must be balanced with the development Detroit has now, and especially with the knowledge that some residents will continue to live in areas that have high-vacancy. The Strategic Framework foresees how the city can evolve from its present pattern—which is spread out and hard to serve—toward a city of connected neighborhoods where employment, residences, and activities are all close by, or are connected in an efficient system of high-speed transit routes and green, landscaped boulevards. Some areas of the city that have already moved away from residential land use will be suited for new land uses and development types, including new green infrastructure that works to clean the air and water and support the health of the whole city and region. Services will be scaled to the number of people and uses in each area of the city.</p>
                <p><strong>SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION.</strong> Three major transformations underpin the change in Detroit’s systems—strategic renewal of infrastructure to suit demand, deploying surplus land as a form of infrastructure (radically changing the image of the city in the process), and changing the culture of transportation (to enhance connections and minimize environmental impact).</p>
                <p>The goal of reconfiguring services is to continue to providing core services—including water, sewerage, gas, electricity, and communications services—to all Detroiters wherever they work and live, while also serving all the needs for existing and growing businesses. Delivering the change that has escaped the city in the past will require coordinated effort among all system providers, public and private. This coordination will need to be planned and carried out from a central point of accountability, in order to transform the city’s infrastructure and service quality.</p>
