                <h2>The State of Detroit's City Systems</h2>
                <p><strong>DETROITERS PAY TOO MUCH FOR TOO LITTLE.</strong> As some areas of Detroit have withstood an exodus of more than 80% of residents, those who remained bore the brunt of the cost for services. Yet the revenue from these households was not enough for the major renewal or replacement that would have brought systems in line with modern environmental and efficiency standards. Although the relationships between rates and numbers of residents is more complicated with regard to the private service providers, (because they may operate related services both within and outside of the city limits), for both public and private providers, the fixed costs for services are being spread over a progressively smaller number of residents and businesses. The rates charged for these services are tending to rise and, in some cases, are becoming too expensive for households to maintain. In short, rates for residents are rising, the costs to serve the city are also rising and yet, level and quality of service is tending to fall for most residents.
                <p><strong>LEGACY SYSTEMS NO LONGER SERVE THE REAL DETROIT.</strong> The city’s main systems were planned for larger city with a heavier load of industrial activity than Detroit has today. The legacy systems of Detroit are not right for the new city. The system’s capacity far exceeds what is needed today: sometimes usage levels are as low as 30-40% of designed capacity). Not only are the systems mismatched to the restructured (and restructuring) city, they are also aging. Many have already reached the end of their effective design lives and many more will do so during the next twenty years. Aging systems malfunction more often, which when compounded by climate change can have severe economic and personal consequences (flooding is a particular example of this). In many cases the systems are operated and managed following models that are no longer appropriate to the current situation of the city. Personnel shortages and training deficiencies contribute further to these problems.</p>
                <p><strong>TRADITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE.</strong> Existing infrastructure systems are struggling in Detroit, placing increasing fiscal burdens on residents and continuing to impact the environment and human health adversely. With aging systems, shrinking budgets, retiring staff, and a declining population, these problems will only grow over time. Addressing these problems cannot be done conventionally; there is a need to find new ways to address city needs. City residents need access to clean air, soil, and water for good health. Local wildlife and migrating birds need access to areas of suitable contiguous habitat.</p>
                <p>Changing climatic conditions in the future may cause the problem to worsen, particularly with regard to the stormwater issue in Detroit. Climate change may bring changes in long-term precipitation patterns and an increased frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events. Short-term, very intense rainstorms pose the greatest challenge for Detroit’s stormwater system. Detroit’s soil conditions, which have very low permeability, lead to high runoff rates, and the Wastewater Treatment Plant cannot handle these sudden, severe spikes in runoff.</p>

                <p><strong>HEALTH HAZARDS.</strong> Detroiters have been harmed by dangerous conditions caused or contributed to by the city’s inefficient systems. For example, Detroit has a combined wastewater/stormwater system, and when system flows exceed treatment capacity, untreated combined sewage/stormwater overflows into the Detroit and Rouge Rivers. Detroit’s wastewater treatment plant is the largest in North America yet cannot handle the stormwater/wastewater flows brought to it during many heavy rain events. These discharges occur at a number of outfall locations along the Detroit and Rouge Rivers, and in 2011, the greatest volumes of diluted (untreated) discharge occurred near downtown.</p>
                <p>Poor air quality along transportation and industrial corridors is responsible for significant human health problems. As a result Detroiters have among the highest rates of asthma and related respiratory diseases nationally. African Americans and the poor are disproportionately affected due to the legacy of racially charged policies that targeted these communities as receivers of new highways, incinerators and industrial activity.</p>
                <p><strong>THE BURDEN ON LOWER-INCOME RESIDENTS AND CHILDREN.</strong> Lower income, minority residents, and children are more frequently exposed to hazards and also more likely to get sick from this exposure. They are more likely to</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>live or work near environmental hazards;</li>
                        <li>have trouble getting health care and health information because of a wide variety of barriers, including lack of health insurance and problems with transportation; and</li>
                        <li>experience difficulties affording and accessing foods to ensure a healthy diet.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Adverse health impacts disproportionately affect children, who are more at risk because their exposure potential is greater (greater likelihood to come into contact with contaminants), exposure can be disproportionately more harmful to their small bodies than to an adult’s, and their maturing nervous systems are more susceptible to damage. Lead is a particularly harmful substance for children because exposure at a young age permanently affects their potential to succeed later in life. Lead exposure can impair brain development, impair growth, and cause children to be inattentive, hyperactive, irritable, and have problems with learning, reading, and memory.</p>

                <p><strong>THE CASE FOR LANDSCAPE.</strong> 20th century infrastructures such as highways often divided neighborhoods and degraded environments, but landscape is a new form of infrastructure for the 21st century city that brings people together and functions ecologically.</p>
                <p>Landscapes can perform infrastructure functions less expensively than conventional systems. Landscape can be adapted to serve stormwater/wastewater, energy, roads/transportation, and waste infrastructure systems. Blue infrastructures are water-based landscapes like swales, retention ponds, and lakes that capture and clean stormwater, reducing the quantity and improving the quality of water that enters the combined stormwater/sewage system. Reducing water that enters the system will help reduce the frequency and quantity of illegal discharges into the Detroit and Route Rivers. Blue infrastructure provides an active use for vacant land and oversized roads. Converting portions of under-used roads to swales reduces road maintenance costs. Green infrastructures are forest landscapes that improve air quality by capturing air-borne pollutants from industry, vehicular exhaust along interstates, and infrastructure facilities like the Detroit Recovery Facility, which incinerates household waste. Green infrastructure also includes greenways, paths and dedicated lanes for bicycling, walking, and running.</p>
                <p>Landscape infrastructure can act as multiple kinds of infrastructure at once; blue and green corridors capture stormwater while working with multimodal transit strategies and plugging into employment centers and retail/commercial nodes. In doing so, landscape systems have benefits that carry far beyond the inherent function they serve. Landscape infrastructures provide a wide range of benefits:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>environmental benefits: clean air, improve water quality, capture stormwater, clean soil, provide habitat for local wildlife and migrating birds</li>
                        <li>fiscal and economic benefits: reduce maintenance and utility costs, perform roles of traditional systems, create jobs, produce food and other tangible products; create an attractive, unique environment that can draw new businesses to Detroit</li>
                        <li>social benefits: allow for recreation and promote other forms of social life; stabilize neighborhoods by acting as an amenity that helps to increase property values; improve resident health and comfort; provide new uses for and management of currently vacant land; remake the image of the city</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Landscapes can address environmental justice issues by cleaning contaminated soil, improving air quality, buffering impacts of industry/infrastructure on residents, and reducing the cost of service (by reducing construction and operating costs). In short, landscape can help ensure that environmental burdens are not born disproportionately by Detroit’s most vulnerable residents, especially people living on modest incomes or in poverty, and children. Landscapes create healthier neighborhoods for all Detroiters, and a new green image for the city.</p>
