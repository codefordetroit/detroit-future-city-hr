Strategies and Implementation

Plans for Implementation

The Strategic Framework proposes five strategies to grow an equitable economy for Detroit:

* Support the Four Key Economic Growth Pillars that have already demonstrated promising job growth: education and medical employment (“Eds and Meds”), digital and creative jobs, industrial employment (both traditional and new technologies, large-scale and artisanal, manufacture, and processes), and local entrepreneurship.
* Use place-based strategies to create core investment and employment corridors, focusing on seven employment districts where job growth is already occurring;
* Encourage local entrepreneurship and minority-owned business;  
* Improve education and skills development; and
* Transform the city’s land into an economic asset.

Each strategy is designed to address specific challenges but also to reinforce the other four strategies. These strategies are also designed to be flexible to actual economic conditions and changing needs in the city and region, and thus are not tied to specific horizons or timelines. They are consistent, however, with the Strategic Framework’s vision for 
stabilization and transformation over a period of 20 to 50 years. Detroit’s public, private, civic and philanthropic stakeholders should align their investments and programmatic initiatives with the broader Framework and with each other’s objectives.

The core mechanism for this coordination is strengthening seven existing employment districts in the city. Information from land surveys, data on the city’s economy, and interviews with key stakeholders formed the basis for mapping these districts. The unique characteristics of each district are identified not only for their economic potential, but for the diverse opportunities each offers to employ people with a broad range of interests and skills.

The Framework recommends:

* Formalizing the importance of these districts through land use and zoning changes; and
* Encouraging public, private, and philanthropic investments in infrastructure and real estate to support these districts.

The strategies also emphasize strengthening the city’s minority business community through expanded opportunities for business ownership and growth. Finally, the plan attempts to create linkages between education and training and opportunities to utilize newly developed skills and address skills gaps and opportunity gaps together, efficiently and fairly.

The success of the plan will rest on the capacity of the strategies to unlock the vast potential of the city’s land assets. Through preferential zoning, targeted infrastructure investments, attraction of new capital into the city, and innovative approaches to address under-utilization of land, the strategy aims to increase the value of and investments in the city’s highest-potential jobs-producing land. If successful, the city’s available land can become its greatest economic asset.

A Support four key economic pillars

A strategy that targets the sectors of the economy that are most likely to generate broad-based economic growth will allow the public, private, and philanthropic sectors to align strategies and resources around economic growth “pillars” that can create jobs, foster economic opportunity and social equity, and best utilize the city’s land assets. These opportunities fall into four broad categories: Education and Medical; Industrial; Digital/Creative; and Local Entrepreneurship.

The most recent 30-year regional employment forecast for Detroit, developed by the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG), shows some employment growth in Detroit between 2010 and 2015, followed by a leveling off after 2015. For the entire 2010-2040 period, SEMCOG projects the entire Southeast Michigan regional economy will add 300,000 net new jobs, of which just over 7,000 will land in the City of Detroit. Although these projections provide an important sightline into the dynamics of the city’s and region’s economies, and can be used as a baseline for understanding future job growth, they suffer from an unavoidable flaw: They were developed assuming “business as usual.”

The “business as usual” projections do not account for or anticipate the potential impact of aligning future investments with existing major civic investments in the four pillar economic areas. Coupled with critical changes in the city’s productive landscape— including the resurgence of the downtown district and the emergence of the city as a hub for digital and creative businesses—these investments indicate that continued, intentional investment in the Four Key Economic Growth Pillars will yield potent benefits.

Implementation actions: 
1. Align cluster strategies with the Detroit Strategic Framework. 
2. Establish cluster-based collaboration with labor market intermediaries.


B. Use a place-based strategy for growth

Seven specific employment districts have the greatest potential to unleash large- scale job creation in Detroit. These districts will promote a deliberate spatial pattern to business activity, generate multiple benefits to the economy, and help alleviate critical fiscal and social issues in the city. Reinvesting in specific employment districts will create the scale required for efficient investments in infrastructure and services; allow development of effective strategies for building demolition and land assembly; and create dense employment nodes that can facilitate transportation connections between Detroit residents and businesses, an issue that currently plagues the least-advantaged Detroiters but also employers who would benefit from a larger labor pool with more reliable transportation options. This concept will have a secondary (but critical) effect of raising property values in the employment districts, thus reducing the required subsidy for new construction and creating conditions to support private real estate activity.

These efforts will rely on an alignment among all levels of government (city, state, federal), the private sector, and the philanthropic community. Many in the private sector have voiced support for concentrating economic activity, with the understanding that it will increase the feasibility and efficiency of private-sector attempts to address shortcomings in the existing operating environment. Some private companies already pool resources to fund shared security and emergency services. Concentrating activity would make these investments more efficient and could create conditions for private-public-philanthropic partnerships to address other critical issues like transportation linkages between residents and employment opportunities. To help target resources and develop effective infrastructure, land use, and worker-support policies, each employment district will require a menu of strategies and investments tailored to the opportunities they present.

Implementation Actions

1. Align public, private, and philanthropic investments in employment districts.
2. Develop detailed action plans for primary employment districts. 
3. Encourage industrial business improvement districts (IBIDS).
4. Become a national leader in green industrial districts.

C. Encourage local entrepreneurship and minority business participation

As many Detroit leaders have recognized, growing the base of the city’s entrepreneurs is a great opportunity for employment and wealth creation. Opportunities for the self-employed and small businesses are likely to increase over time: Nationally, employment growth has been fastest in those parts of the economy that serve local markets rather than national and international (“traded”) markets. These opportunities will grow as consumers turn increasingly to local products and larger national and international companies continue to outsource secondary functions, such as building and facilities maintenance. These are significant but often overlooked opportunities. For example, the Local Business Services cluster (“Local B2B”) in Detroit employs about 25,000 people (including self-employed) and could employ thousands more if local demand for these services was met by Detroit-based companies. The opportunities that exist in Detroit today can support different forms of enterprise, self-employment, small business ownership, and scaling of existing businesses.

The local business clusters are also a good opportunity to diversify the city’s base of businesses. Many of the opportunities in the local clusters do not require large amounts of start-up capital, yet offer proximity to a large and broad base of customers. Moreover, some of the infrastructure to support these initiatives has already been built. The Midtown educational and medical institutions are national leaders in identifying opportunities for local suppliers, and DEGC has started a multi- year Local B2B initiative to increase local opportunities in this cluster. Broadening and deepening existing efforts and identifying new opportunities could lead to the creation of thousands of jobs in the city.

Implementation actions

1. Promote short-term approaches to increase the number and success of MBEs and DBEs in the City.
2 Support the development of low-cost, shared spaces for clusters with high levels of self employment.
3 Provide young Detroiters with exposure to and experience in Digital / Creative and other new economy clusters.
4 Develop a comprehensive long-term strategy to increase and strengthen the City’s MBEs.

D. Improve skills and support education reform


Skills building and education reform are key factors driving economic growth in Detroit. Even more important, they shape opportunity, incomes, and quality of life for Detroiters. Although the Framework does not discuss K-12 reform, the strategies here will complement K-12 improvement in the city’s public schools by increasing high school graduation rates and improving the value of two-year degrees held by Detroiters; better linking the needs of employers with workforce training investments, a direction already underway among the city’s workforce training providers and community colleges; increasing training opportunities for degreed Detroiters already in the workforce; developing strategies to address challenges faced by African American high school graduates nationally in securing full-time employment opportunities;8 and in general, increasing overall opportunities for Detroiters by better linking residents to Detroit jobs as well as overcoming challenges with physical access to workforce opportunities by better aligning employment and training locations with residential areas in the city.

This approach attempts to increase the opportunities and means for Detroiters to improve their education and skills levels, then reward these investments with job opportunities, career paths, and higher wages. The approach recognizes that education and skills are the primary determinants of economic quality of life and must be matched with opportunities to utilize these skills and be rewarded.

Implementation Actions

1. “Hire Detroit”: Strengthen local hiring practices.
2. Link workforce investments to transportation.
3. Coordinate workforce development best practices.
4. Revitalize incumbent workforce training.
5. Expand public-private partnerships for workforce development.
6. Commission a study to identify levers to improve graduation rates and poor labor market outcomes of Detroiters.
