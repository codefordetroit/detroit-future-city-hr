Imperatives and Quality of Business

Economic Growth Actions And Impact

We must re-energize Detroit’s economy to increase job opportunities for Detroiters within the city and strengthen the tax base.

We must support our current residents and attract new residents.

Detroit has been losing population and employment for decades, and years of fiscal challenges have hollowed out local government capacity. Detroit today provides a challenging business environment marred by high levels of blight, security issues, and significant gaps in local government services. Potential buyers driving to inspect available industrial sites are often deterred by the visible levels of blight before they have even arrived at the property. These factors often frustrate existing business owners and employees, increase costs, and deter investment. Businesses, like residents, desire a secure, attractive environment and a larger, vibrant business community. For Detroit to thrive as a city, the quality of the business environment must be considered as important as the quality of residential life. This will require improvements in the following areas:

* Costs: The operating cost environment for businesses compared to * regional and peer cities.
* Network: Proximity to related businesses, suppliers, and * business services are a key ingredient in location decisions and * operating success.
* Information: There are many information gaps that need to be * filled to align businesses with workforce, incentives, and public * services.
* Services: Effective and reliable government services are needed * to support existing and new businesses.
* Access: Detroit has a legacy of quality, and diverse * infrastructure. Strategic improvements are needed to ensure * efficient access via highway, rail, ports, and local streets.
* Regulations: Permitting, zoning, and other codes need to be * reconfigured to support local job and business growth.
* Safety: Safety and security of people and buildings is often cited as a key concern by business owners.
