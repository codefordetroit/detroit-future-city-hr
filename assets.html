			<h4>Ideas</h4>

			<h5><a name="vision"></a>1. A city that shares a vision: coordinating the management of vacant land</h5>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="span6">
				<p>Public land and facility strategies must be aligned with the City&apos;s strategies for neighborhood revitalization, economic growth, and creation of blue/green infrastructure, while the activities of each of the public landholding entities as well as other public agencies must be grounded in a single coordinated strategic framework.</p>

				<p>We need to begin thinking of properties in public ownership and those in private ownership as part of a single system. All land, whatever its legal ownership, is public in the sense that how it is used and maintained affects its neighbors and the community as a whole, and affects the city&apos;s ability to preserve its neighborhoods and build its economy. More important than who actually owns the inventory is how it fits into the vision for the city. Detroit needs to develop a coordinated system in which all entities operate consistently across all aspects of public land management and private land regulation, making decisions based on clear policy goals and principles, and utilizing available legal and financial tools as efficiently as possible. Wherever title to any single parcel resides, that parcel should be seen as being part of single inventory, guided by a single set of policies and goals.</p>

				<p>Such a profound change in thinking and procedures will not be easy. The transformation of Detroit&apos;s approach to its land will require many separate agencies, with separate missions and priorities, to subordinate their differences to a common direction and purpose, and to foster unprecedented connections among landholding, regulatory, and user agencies. In the long run, public landholding agencies and those leading the city&apos;s regeneration should explore realignment of responsibilities, including reducing the number of separate entities holding title to public parcels, to increase the system&apos;s efficiency and take better advantage of the legal and technical capacities of particular agencies.</p>

				<h5><a name="connected"></a>2. A city where everything is connected: viewing vacant and problem properties within one interrelated system</h5>

				<p>Detroit contains an estimated 150,000 vacant properties, roughly 2/3 vacant land parcels and the rest vacant buildings. Of these, the eight public landholding entities control about 66,000, or well under half. In addition, the city contains an unknown number of problem properties that are still occupied, including underutilized, poorly maintained industrial buildings and many absentee-owned houses and small apartment buildings suffering from neglect.</p>

				<p>Historically, the respective systems designed to deal with publicly owned and privately owned properties have not been integrated. The latter is managed as a regulatory function, and has regrettably suffered from the lack of resources that burdens many of Detroit&apos;s systems. Many ordinances are on the books, but are poorly or intermittently enforced, with too few personnel to keep up with the volume of properties.</p>

				<p><strong>Decisions about vacant land and problem properties, whether in public or private ownership, need to be made through a single lens:</strong> How will these properties be treated, so their outcomes will benefit the city by stabilizing neighborhoods, fostering economic growth, and creating opportunities for new infrastructure and innovation, rather than continue to act as a drag on the city&apos;s future?</p>

				<h5><a name="approaches"></a>3. A city of strategic approaches: recognizing the uniqueness of each property&apos;s value and challenges</h5>

				<p>A coordinated approach to addressing Detroit&apos;s vacant land must begin with a strategic approach to addressing the land in public ownership to maximize the city&apos;s ability to create long-term value and enhance community amenities and quality of life through its use and reuse. <strong>This approach must be grounded in a basic principle: Vacant land is not fungible—each property has its own problems, and its own potentials.</strong> Every decision a public agency makes about land has strategic implications; this applies to the following areas:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Property acquisition, including establishing policies about which properties should be added to the public inventory;</li>
					<li>Property disposition, including determining the most appropriate reuse, identifying suitable buyers, and selecting the most appropriate disposition methods;</li>
					<li>Property holding strategies, including when properties should be held for long-term public purposes, for assembly into more buildable or marketable sites, or for future reuse potential;</li>
					<li>Maintenance of public land; and</li>
					<li>Demolition of vacant structures</li>
				</ul>

				<p>All decisions about public land, from acquisition to disposition, should be made on the basis of strategic principles designed to lead to the best results for the city from that decision.</p>

				<h5><a name="landscape"></a>4. A new urban landscape: using land for infrastructure  and innovation</h5>

				<p>Many people in Detroit, as elsewhere, still think of reuse of vacant land as equivalent to redevelopment of new buildings to replace the ones that have been torn down. Yet the reality is that, outside certain key locations, continuing demographic and economic trends mean that little new development will take place in Detroit for many years. <strong>This is a challenge, but also a great opportunity. It means that Detroit&apos;s vast inventory of vacant land can be used for a variety of new purposes, to foster innovations in public open space, urban agriculture, clean energy, and more; and to build a new network of blue/green infrastructure to divert stormwater from the city&apos;s overtaxed sewer system and clean the city&apos;s air.</strong></p>

				<p>Pursuing this idea also demands a change in attitude toward the large areas of vacant land that cover many parts of the city. Rather than seeing this land as largely worthless, and being eager to unload it to any willing private party, the public sector should see this land as being of value, and of creating large, contiguous tracts where current holdings may be substantial but fragmented. This, in turn, calls for greater emphasis on holding rather than selling public land, and on making it more costly for private entities—often speculators—to hold onto vacant parcels instead of using them productively or relinquishing them.</p>

				<p>It also requires us to think about the smaller lots in traditional neighborhoods not as necessarily future infill sites, but as long-term open spaces in those neighborhoods, and to ensure that they are used in ways that strengthen, rather than undermine, the fabric of those areas.</p>

				<p>Finally, it calls for an open-minded, creative approach to innovation and experimentation. The sheer scale of the vacant land available creates the opportunity to try out different reuse alternatives, some of which may be new and largely untried. Both through its land use regulations and its disposition policies, the City should encourage the full range of ideas for reuse of vacant land in ways that hold promise to further the city&apos;s revitalization and enhance its quality of life.</p>

				<h5><a name="count"></a>5. A city where public facility investments count: aligning public facilities with land use transformation</h5>

				<p>Much of the public land inventory in Detroit is made up of public facilities, including public schools, parks, recreation facilities and community centers, police substations, and more. Those facilities are an important part of the ‘glue&apos; holding the city&apos;s neighborhoods together, and defining the quality of life in those neighborhoods. Today, as a result of declining population and financial resources, many of those facilities, particularly school buildings, have been closed, and many 271 others, including many of the city&apos;s parks, fall short of their promise. Population and fiscal constraints are realities that cannot be wished away, but a different approach can be taken within those constraints to integrate decisions about public facilities into larger decisions about Detroit&apos;s future land use.</p>

				<p>Decisions about public facilities are being made in Detroit every year—whether to close a facility or invest money in upgrading it, whether to close a park or reduce its ongoing maintenance, where to consolidate public facilities and services, how to reuse vacant facilities, and more. Each of these decisions affects far more than the facility itself. <strong>Going forward, all such decisions should be aligned with the larger strategies governing the future of the neighborhoods and other areas in which they are located, so that their outcomes enhance the stability of neighborhoods slated for revitalization, or help further the conversion of others areas into blue/green infrastructure or other non-development reuses.</strong></p>

			<h4>Strategies and Actions</h4>

				<h5><a name="a"></a>A. Target vacant public land and buildings in employment districts for emplyoment growth</h5>

				<p>Detroit has strong assets for economic growth, yet is held back by the shortage of ‘move-in&apos; buildings and shovel-ready buildable sites into which local firms can expand, and new firms from outside Detroit can locate. The strategic reuse of public land holdings—coupled with an aggressive strategy to make private land speculation more costly—may be the critical element in Detroit&apos;s ability to realize its economic growth potential. By positioning publicly and privately owned vacant land in and around economic growth employment districts for assembly and reuse, Detroit can level the playing field to compete with suburban greenfield development opportunities.</p>
				
				<p>Detroit needs a series of highly focused strategies to create sites that can be marketed on short notice to potential users, as well as to create opportunities for existing firms to grow their businesses. These strategies fall into three broad categories:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>strategic acquisition and assembly of properties to create desirable and buildable sites;</li>
					<li>targeted disposition of properties to developers and end users around specific economic development goals, while holding properties for further assembly; and</li>
					<li>strategies to increase the cost of holding vacant land and buildings by private owners, while fostering the greater use of underused industrial and commercial buildings.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These strategies are detailed in the next section on using land assets for economic growth.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Identify strategic targets for acquisition of properties by public entities.</li>
						<li>Adopt policies for targeted disposition and holding of properties in economic growth areas.</li>
						<li>Increase the cost of holding vacant property.</li>
						<li>Adopt program to foster greater use of underused buildings.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5><a name="b"></a>B. Use vacant public land as a tool for neighborhood stabilization.</h5>

				<p>While not the only factor threatening the stability of Detroit&apos;s vital yet at-risk residential neighborhoods, the proliferation of vacant lots and empty buildings scattered around those areas are a significant force blighting these neighborhoods and accelerating their decline. Factors contributing to blight include the inadequate maintenance that many lots receive, difficulty in putting them back into neighborhood-enhancing reuse, housing vacancy and abandonment, and the continued proliferation of privately owned vacant lots and problem buildings. Targeted strategies for these sites can minimize their blighting effect and turn them into neighborhood assets.</p>

				<p>High priority must be given to actions to remove existing blighting elements in at- risk neighborhoods, and to the extent possible, prevent future blighting elements from appearing. Specific strategies that should be pursued include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>systematically reusing vacant lots in ways that contribute to neighborhood stability, such as community gardens, side lots, and other landscape treatments to create attractive low-maintenance environments;</li>
					<li>expeditiously recycling vacant and abandoned houses for reoccupancy where feasible, or demolition where reoccupancy is not feasible;</li>
					<li>adopting regulatory programs and incentives to motivate more responsible ownership by absentee landlords; and</li>
					<li>increasing the cost of holding vacant land and buildings by private owners.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>All of these actions should be planned and implemented through partnerships among city agencies, neighborhood associations and community development corporations, to leverage the energy and human resources that these organizations are willing and ready to bring to stabilize and rebuild their neighborhoods.</p>

				<p>These activities should be coordinated closely with other neighborhood stabilization activities, including steps to increase public safety, foster greater home ownership, and build stronger neighborhood organizations.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Reuse vacant lots to enhance neighborhood stability.</li>
						<li>Adopt targeted demolition strategy based on stabilization priorities.</li>
						<li>Address problem landlords.</li>
						<li>Increase the cost of holding vacant property.</li>
						<li>Pursue targeted neighborhood stabilization strategies.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5><a name="c"></a>C. Transform largely vacant areas through blue and green infrastructure</h5>

				<p>Large parts of Detroit are dominated by vacant land and buildings with little or no short-term or medium-term development potential, but with the ability to be turned into valuable assets for the city through a variety of green reuse alternatives. Today&apos;s largely unmanaged, chaotic vacant land environment in these areas contributes to the sense of neglect felt in many parts of the city, undermining the quality of life not only for the residents of these areas, but for the city as a whole.</p>

				<p>Perhaps the most dramatic potential for transformation lies in the use of public land for blue/green infrastructure; that is, reuse of land to absorb stormwater and divert it from the city&apos;s sewer system, or to clean the air and improve community health. Reusing vacant land in these ways can save the city hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in sewer upgrading costs while creating landscaped and maintained marshes, lakes, greenways, and forests that will remove blight, enhance their surroundings while linking them to the rest of the city, and potentially create future market value and redevelopment opportunities.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Hold land between interstates/industrial areas and neighborhoods for green infrastructure (do not release for future residential development).</li>
						<li>Acquire available land for blue infrastructure in key locations.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5><a name="d"></a>D. Link public facility and property decisions to larger strategies.</h5>

				<p>In recent years, many schools, parks, recreation centers, police substations, and other public facilities have been closed as Detroit adjusts to new fiscal and demographic realities. Some have been used for other purposes, while many sit vacant. At the same time, Detroit Public Schools has built, expanded, or upgraded other school facilities. Decisions about which facilities should be closed, or where services or maintenance should be reduced or enhanced, as well as the reuse of vacant facilities, should be guided by the City&apos;s land use and neighborhood stabilization goals, in order to maximize the value of existing facilities and reduce the blighting effect of vacant buildings and the potential destabilizing effect of future closings. At the same time, the presence of a number of new or significantly upgraded school facilities represents an important opportunity for neighborhood stabilization. Targeted neighborhood strategies around new or significantly upgraded schools, along with co-location of other community-serving activities can maximize their value as neighborhood assets while enhancing the quality of life in the surrounding area.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Create priority system for public land and parks acquisition.</li>
						<li>Create joint policies and system for disposition of public property.</li>
						<li>Adopt coordinated maintenance strategy for public land.</li>
						<li>Adopt targeted demolition strategy based on stabilization priorities.</li>
						<li>Use new and upgraded schools as community anchors for stabilization.</li>
						<li>Review criteria for school closing to reflect neighborhood stability factors.</li>
						<li>Update parks and recreation facilities planning to reflect current and future populations and budgets (update aspects of 2006 Strategic Master Plan by the DRD).</li>
						<li>Parks and recreation planning at neighborhood scales: refine citywide strategy of Detroit Strategic Framework through smaller-scaled analysis.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5><a name="e"></a>E. Incorporate more innovative vacant land maintenance strategies</h5>

				Only a handful of the thousands of vacant sites in Detroit are likely to see redevelopment—in the sense of new buildings—over the next decade or more. As demolitions continue to take place, the number of vacant parcels is likely to grow. If there is one central question that must drive the entire discussion of public land, it is this: how can one transform these thousands of parcels from their current status, where they blight neighborhoods and form barriers between communities, to a new status in which they become assets, enhancing rather than blighting their surroundings, and linking rather than separating the different parts of the city?

				While vacant land today fragments the city, isolating neighborhoods from one another, it can become a vehicle for re-knitting the city&apos;s fabric. The secret lies in giving a central role to the use of landscape in its many forms and variations, as laid out elsewhere in this Framework as the vehicle for transforming vacant land into a productive part of the urban environment, whether with respect to ongoing maintenance, short-term holding uses, or long-term reuse for purposes such as stormwater management, urban agriculture, carbon forests, and more. Landscape needs to become a central rather than a peripheral element in Detroit&apos;s toolkit of urban land uses. This is as true in neighborhoods—where many scattered vacant parcels need to be integrated into the community fabric through sensitive landscape treatments—as in high-vacancy areas, where large-scale uses for vacant land are needed.

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Adjust city maintenance standards, strategies, and practices to vary by framework zone and future land use (do not mow all vacant lots in city regardless of location, but instead adopt different lower-cost maintenance strategies in different areas); look for partnerships to help with land maintenance.</li>
						<li>Form partnerships with community groups and other organizations, businesses, and individuals to help maintain land.</li>
						<li>Refine set of landscape maintenance typologies and develop cost estimates to implement.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5><a name="f"></a>F. Use more aggressive regulative tools</h5>

				Well over half of the vacant properties in Detroit are privately owned, including the great majority of the city&apos;s vacant buildings. No vacant property strategy that focuses entirely on the publicly owned inventory, yet fails to address the private inventory, can hope to be transformative for the city&apos;s future. In addition to vacant properties, large numbers of occupied but poorly maintained properties, often owned by short-term speculators, are destabilizing the city&apos;s neighborhoods, while rising numbers of properties—vacant and occupied—are appearing on the county&apos;s annual tax auctions. More aggressive, targeted strategies to address these challenges need to be an integral part of the public land strategy.

				The City needs to establish clear standards for maintenance of vacant properties by private owners, and use its regulatory authority aggressively to increase the cost of doing business for those owners who do not maintain their properties to the full required standards. Restructuring and effectively enforcing existing vacant property ordinances is an important first step. A second priority should be strategies to motivate responsible landlord behavior and penalize speculators who do not maintain their properties, a critical issue in many neighborhoods where 283 more and more formerly owner-occupied houses are falling into the hands of absentee owners. Finally, the tax foreclosure process, through which thousands of properties move through a revolving door of speculation, foreclosure, and ultimate abandonment, needs to be addressed.

				Neighborhood associations and CDCs need to be full partners with the public land agencies in designing and carrying out these strategies. Not only do these agencies lack the resources to tackle the problem on their own, but many of Detroit&apos;s neighborhood associations and CDCs are actively seeking opportunities to take responsibility for the future of their neighborhoods. Only by tapping their energy— not merely in carrying out City initiatives, but by playing a strong role in framing and designing those initiatives—will Detroit have a realistic chance to succeed in finding new purposes for its vacant land.

			<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
			<ol>
				<li>Increase the cost of holding vacant property.</li>
				<li>Address problem landlords.</li>
				<li>Create formal partnership with Wayne County Treasurer for tax foreclosure auctions.</li>
