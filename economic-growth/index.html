            <h4>Transformative ideas: economic growth</h4>

            <section id="1">
                <p>
                    Unlike many of the country’s struggling cities, Detroit is challenged not with the creation of a new set of economic assets but with a geographic and strategic alignment of existing assets. While it is true that the city’s original land patterns cannot efficiently serve its current residents, the real challenge is this: <strong>Detroit is not too big, its economy is too small</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge of growing Detroit’s economy comes with an important imperative: the need to enhance equity by creating job opportunities for Detroiters of all backgrounds and skill levels. This is not only a desirable output—the right thing to do for people—but a key input for the city’s sustainable economic future—the smart thing to do for business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The good news is that Detroit’s economy is changing, and its economic base is diverse, if modest. Four “pillars” of employment now account for well over half of Detroit’s employment base: education and medical employment (“Eds and Meds”), digital and creative jobs, industrial employment (both traditional and new technologies, large-scale and artisanal, manufacture and processes), and local entrepreneurship. All of these are promising areas of employment, and local entrepreneurship in particular is the “sleeping giant” that could change the economic landscape of Detroit, especially in the areas of business-to-business services (B2B), food processing, and construction / demolition / engineering / repurposing (CDER).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physical corridors of strength and investment have emerged within the city’s checkerboard development patterns. The Strategic Framework proposes an economic strategy that builds on existing trends and unique characteristics in seven employment districts in the city of Detroit, which will serve as strategic areas for investment and new growth, attracting residents and companies to exchange interests, ideas, and innovations. <strong>These seven primary employment districts account for about half of the city’s total employment but take up less than 15% of the city’s land.</strong> Detroit’s physical transformation is intended to create additional job opportunities and tap the incredible potential inherent in the very “problem” that has plagued the city: its miles of vacant and underused spaces. Two emerging industries for Detroit are most promising in this context: food production (taking advantage of Detroit’s resident urban farming movement, the ingenuity of its people, and a growing nationwide interest in locally sourced food); and CDER (construction / demolition / engineering / repurposing, which builds on Detroit’s industrial skills base and makes a virtue of the very necessity to change the landscape). Both of these emerging industries, coupled with Detroit’s existing strength in TDL (transportation, distribution, and logistics), will likely provide thousands of new jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities for Detroiters of all backgrounds and skill levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every job—and every resident—is important to Detroit’s future. <strong>For the city’s economic alignment to yield its full potential, economic growth in Detroit must be fair and must benefit all of the city’s residents.</strong> This plan recognizes equitable growth not only because it is the right thing to do, but because it makes good business sense: By increasing Detroiters’ access to employment and entrepreneurship, the city will grow its base of workers and business owners, while increasing incentives for and investment in further education and training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Detroit strengthens the key actors and assets within the city, it will also be able to tighten the linkages between the city and regional economies, maintaining its position as a global trade center. The vision of the Strategic Framework is a strong, equitable urban economy that anchors the revitalization of the larger metropolitan economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Framework is also designed to be adaptable to the conditions in the regional, national, and international economies. The intent was to provide a framework for action that is flexible and dynamic, yet establishes a strong structure to support both growth and equal opportunities.
                </p>

                <h5>A day in the life: fulfilling our economic potential</h5>
                <p>
                    Darius lives in Northwest Detroit with his wife Barbara, a medical technician, and his two kids Bakari, 17, and Hope, 15. It’s been a tough decade, but things are looking up. Not too long ago Darius was unemployed because of cutbacks at the auto factory he’d worked at since high school. The only job Barbara could find was in the suburbs, and her daily commute began at 4:30 a.m. by bus so Darius could have the car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How’d they recover? In 2012, the city government and its business partners began focusing on four key areas of job growth, including 21st century industrial work. Through a new training partnership between a local university and a foundation, Darius touched up his advanced- technology skills and landed a job within 60 days of receiving his certificate. Jobs in the city were picking up rapidly, since the city had focused its business development in seven strategic employment districts. Businesses locating in these districts attracted others in similar fields, and all of them were hiring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Barbara soon got a job, too, at a new clinic in the “Eds and Meds” district in the McNichols corridor. She takes one of the city’s rapid bus lines to work now, getting there in about 20 minutes. Bakari and Hope take the rapid bus to school, too, and they even take the bus to after- school activities at the library (SAT practice for Bakari, digital photography for Hope). With everyone’s commute time cut, dinner begins at 6 p.m. sharp: Just in time for a family report on everyone’s day.
                </p>
