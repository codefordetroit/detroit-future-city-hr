            <h4>Strategies and actions</h4>

            <section id="1">
                <h5>A. Support four key economic pillars</h5>

                <p>A strategy that targets the sectors of the economy that are most likely to generate broad-based economic growth will allow the public, private, and philanthropic sectors to align strategies and resources around economic growth &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; that can create jobs, foster economic opportunity and social equity, and best utilize the city&apos;s land assets. These opportunities fall into four broad categories: Education and Medical; Industrial; Digital/Creative; and Local Entrepreneurship.</p>

                <p>The most recent 30-year regional employment forecast for Detroit, developed by the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG), shows some employment growth in Detroit between 2010 and 2015, followed by a leveling off after 2015. For the entire 2010-2040 period, SEMCOG projects the entire Southeast Michigan regional economy will add 300,000 net new jobs, of which just over 7,000 will land in the City of Detroit. Although these projections provide an important sightline into the dynamics of the city&apos;s and region&apos;s economies, and can be used as a baseline for understanding future job growth, they suffer from an unavoidable flaw: They were developed assuming &ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>The &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; projections do not account for or anticipate the potential impact of aligning future investments with existing major civic investments in the four pillar economic areas. Coupled with critical changes in the city&apos;s productive landscape— including the resurgence of the downtown district and the emergence of the city as a hub for digital and creative businesses—these investments indicate that continued, intentional investment in the Four Key Economic Growth Pillars will yield potent benefits.</p>

                    <h6>Implementation actions: </h6>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Align cluster strategies with the Detroit Strategic Framework.</li> 
                        <li>Establish cluster-based collaboration with labor market intermediaries.</li>
                    </ol>
            </section>


            <section id="2">
                <h5><a name="b"></a>B. Use a place-based strategy for growth</h5>

                <p>Seven specific employment districts have the greatest potential to unleash large- scale job creation in Detroit. These districts will promote a deliberate spatial pattern to business activity, generate multiple benefits to the economy, and help alleviate critical fiscal and social issues in the city. Reinvesting in specific employment districts will create the scale required for efficient investments in infrastructure and services; allow development of effective strategies for building demolition and land assembly; and create dense employment nodes that can facilitate transportation connections between Detroit residents and businesses, an issue that currently plagues the least-advantaged Detroiters but also employers who would benefit from a larger labor pool with more reliable transportation options. This concept will have a secondary (but critical) effect of raising property values in the employment districts, thus reducing the required subsidy for new construction and creating conditions to support private real estate activity.</p>

                <p>These efforts will rely on an alignment among all levels of government (city, state, federal), the private sector, and the philanthropic community. Many in the private sector have voiced support for concentrating economic activity, with the understanding that it will increase the feasibility and efficiency of private-sector attempts to address shortcomings in the existing operating environment. Some private companies already pool resources to fund shared security and emergency services. Concentrating activity would make these investments more efficient and could create conditions for private-public-philanthropic partnerships to address other critical issues like transportation linkages between residents and employment opportunities. To help target resources and develop effective infrastructure, land use, and worker-support policies, each employment district will require a menu of strategies and investments tailored to the opportunities they present.</p>

                    <h6>Implementation Actions</h6>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Align public, private, and philanthropic investments in employment  districts.</li>
                        <li>Develop detailed action plans for primary employment districts. </li>
                        <li>Encourage industrial business improvement districts (IBIDS).</li>
                        <li>Become a national leader in green industrial districts.</li>
                    </ol>
            </section>

            
            <section id="3">
                <h5><a name="c"></a>C. Encourage local entrepreneurship and minority business participation</h5>

                <p>As many Detroit leaders have recognized, growing the base of the city&apos;s entrepreneurs is a great opportunity for employment and wealth creation. Opportunities for the self-employed and small businesses are likely to increase over time: Nationally, employment growth has been fastest in those parts of the economy that serve local markets rather than national and international (&ldquo;traded&rdquo;) markets. These opportunities will grow as consumers turn increasingly to local products and larger national and international companies continue to outsource secondary functions, such as building and facilities maintenance. These are significant but often overlooked opportunities. For example, the Local Business Services cluster (&ldquo;Local B2B&rdquo;) in Detroit employs about 25,000 people (including self-employed) and could employ thousands more if local demand for these services was met by Detroit-based companies. The opportunities that exist in Detroit today can support different forms of enterprise, self-employment, small business ownership, and scaling of existing businesses.</p>

                <p>The local business clusters are also a good opportunity to diversify the city&apos;s base of businesses. Many of the opportunities in the local clusters do not require large amounts of start-up capital, yet offer proximity to a large and broad base of customers. Moreover, some of the infrastructure to support these initiatives has already been built. The Midtown educational and medical institutions are national leaders in identifying opportunities for local suppliers, and DEGC has started a multi- year Local B2B initiative to increase local opportunities in this cluster. Broadening and deepening existing efforts and identifying new opportunities could lead to the creation of thousands of jobs in the city.</p>

                <h5><a name="d"></a>D. Improve skills and support education reform</h5>

                <p>Skills building and education reform are key factors driving economic growth in Detroit. Even more important, they shape opportunity, incomes, and quality of life for Detroiters. Although the Framework does not discuss K-12 reform, the strategies here will complement K-12 improvement in the city&apos;s public schools by increasing high school graduation rates and improving the value of two-year degrees held by Detroiters; better linking the needs of employers with workforce training investments, a direction already underway among the city&apos;s workforce training providers and community colleges; increasing training opportunities for degreed Detroiters already in the workforce; developing strategies to address challenges faced by African American high school graduates nationally in securing full-time employment opportunities;8 and in general, increasing overall opportunities for Detroiters by better linking residents to Detroit jobs as well as overcoming challenges with physical access to workforce opportunities by better aligning employment and training locations with residential areas in the city.</p>

                <p>This approach attempts to increase the opportunities and means for Detroiters to improve their education and skills levels, then reward these investments with job opportunities, career paths, and higher wages. The approach recognizes that education and skills are the primary determinants of economic quality of life and must be matched with opportunities to utilize these skills and be rewarded.</p>

                <h5><a name="e"></a>E. Land regulations, transactions, and environmental actions</h5>

                <p>The condition, location, and configuration of Detroit&apos;s job-producing land presents many challenges that are critical to address in order to generate economic activity and jobs for all Detroiters. The regulation of land in employment districts can have far-reaching impacts, including blight reduction, improved safety, and ultimately a surge in private investment.</p>

                <p>A critical opportunity lies in developing and popularizing organizational and funding mechanisms for &ldquo;clean and safe&rdquo; programs to dramatically improve the character and security of Detroit&apos;s industrial and commercial zones and employment centers. Perception is reality, so focusing on the look and feel of key employment areas is essential to their success. Branding and character campaigns can also dramatically improve the allure of certain areas to specific economic clusters, while conceptual site and district planning exercises can help brokers and developers to concretely envision the potential of an area and plan for land assembly as appropriate. In addition, attention to the natural environment will create modern and green employment districts that improve the health of workers and nearby residents.</p>
