            <h4>Realities: the state of Detroit's economy</h4>

            <section id="1">
                <p>
                    Detroit confronts major challenges to its revitalization, including issues with workforce preparedness and employment opportunities for Detroiters; the need to strengthen the performance of the city’s companies, including small- and minority- owned companies; and the need to translate the city’s available land and buildings into affordable, usable spaces that can accommodate growing companies and attract new ones to the city.
                </p>
            </section>


            <section id="2">
                <h5>Ecuational attainment</h5>
                <p>As in many areas that have historically relied on manufacturing to drive the economy, education levels among working-age Detroiters are well below the national average:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>20% do not have a high school degree;</li>
                    <li>35% have a high school degree but no further training;</li>
                    <li>33% have a high school degree and at least some college; and  12% have a bachelor’s degree.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The proportion of Detroit’s population between the ages of 25 and 64 who do not have a high school degree is 60% higher than the U.S. rate of 13%, while the proportion of population holding a four-year degree is 60% lower than the average for the United States.</p>

                <p>But education alone is not the only indicator of Detroit’s workforce challenge: There is a stronger emphasis on education among Detroiters than is often assumed. Of those with a high school degree, 57% have at least some college, comparable to the rest of the United States (68%). Completion rates are lower than the national average, however: Among Detroiters with at least some college, only 42% have completed a two- or four-year degree compared to 64% across the United States.</p>
            </section>


            <section id="3">
                <h5>Labor force participation</h5>

                <p>Among working-age residents in Detroit, labor force participation rates (LFPRs) are low relative to the rest of the region and the United States. In the rest of the region, the participation rate is 79%, nearly identical to the U.S. rate of 78%. If Detroit achieved national participation rates at each education level, about 38,000 additional Detroiters would be in the labor force and the city’s overall participation rate would be 75%. The participation rate of Detroiters without a high school degree is low, but this group accounts for only a small portion of the adult population. The greatest opportunity for impact in labor force participation is among those with a high school degree and/or some college (but not a four-year degree), who account for two-thirds of working-age Detroiters. Consequently, if Detroiters without a high school degree participated in the labor force at national rates, the city’s overall participation rate would increase from 65% to 68%; if Detroiters with a high school degree and/or some college matched national rates, the city’s overall participation rate would increase from 65% to 72%, just below the regional average of 75%.</p>

                <h5>School quality</h5>
                <p>One oft-cited reason for poor labor force outcomes among Detroiters is the low quality of the city’s public schools. Although Detroit’s school system has some high performers like Cass Technical High School, Renaissance High School, Kettering West Wing, and the Bates Academy, the majority of schools under-perform relative to those in neighboring school districts. The Michigan Department of Education’s “Top-to-Bottom Ranking” of the state’s schools shows that in terms of statewide percentile ranking, schools in the Detroit Public Schools district averaged in the 12th percentile. Detroit school performance is also weak by the standards of urban school districts across the United States. In the most recent Trial Urban District Assessment of reading, mathematics, science, and writing skills of 4th and 8th graders in 22 cities, Detroit ranked last, but did show improvement over the previous assessment.</p>

                <h5>Weakened incentives and connections</h5>
                <p>In all groups in all parts of the country, labor force participation rates are sensitive to the costs and rewards of employment, including wages and commuting times. Detroiters of all education levels have wages that are lower than regional and national averages, with the largest gap for those workers without a high school degree and the smallest for the college-educated. This would help explain why labor force activity is so low among the city’s least educated residents. Similarly, the challenges of using public transportation to commute to suburban job centers disproportionately harms less educated, lower-income individuals, who are less likely to own cars.</p>

                <h5>Regional competition</h5>
                <p>Between 2002 and 2010, the proportion of Detroit jobs held by Detroit residents fell from 42% to 30%. Changing skill demands do not seem to be the main culprit: The share of city jobs held by Detroiters declined almost as much for jobs paying less than $1,250 per month as for jobs paying greater than $3,333 per month. What did change during those years was the region’s unemployment rate. During the 2000s, the region lost more than 400,000 jobs, 100,000 more than any other U.S. region, suggesting that the region’s jobs crisis has severely undercut opportunities for less educated workers.</p>

                <p>The least educated workers faced competition for jobs from better-educated job- seekers: in the city but also across the region, those without high school degrees participate in the labor force at rates well below the national average. The gap between regional and national labor force participation narrows with increasing education levels until it more or less disappears for the region’s residents who hold at least a bachelor’s degree.</p>

                <h5>Inequity even with education</h5>
                <p>For all the discussion about the importance of education in addressing the city’s poverty, the disconnect between educational attainment and prosperity is profound for many Detroiters. At all education levels, Detroiters suffer much higher poverty rates than peers in the region and country:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>31% of Detroiters with a high school degree and no college live in poverty, compared to 13% of identically educated Americans;</li>
                    <li>A Detroiter with a two-year college degree is 50% more likely to live in poverty than the average American with only a high school degree; and</li>
                    <li>A Detroiter with a four-year college degree is more likely to live in poverty than the average American with a two-year degree.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In fact, if every working-age Detroiter invested in a two-year degree, the poverty rate in this group would still be almost 21%, higher than overall poverty rates in 70% of U.S. cities

                <h5>Minority business ownership holds great potential</h5>
                <p>Although it is true that a large number of Detroiters have dropped out of the labor force, it is also true that many Detroiters have responded to the shortage of formal job opportunities by starting businesses, becoming self-employed, or moving into the informal economy. African-Americans in Detroit are 15% more likely than their counterparts nationally to be formally self-employed. Overall, there are about 50,000 people who are formally self-employed or own businesses with employees in Detroit, and perhaps as many as 100,000 more who are engaged in the informal economy, either as their only source of income or in addition to formal and/or self- employment.</p>

                <p>Minority residents are strongly represented in “nonemployer firms,” which generally represent formally self-employed persons. These businesses pay taxes and are part of the formal economy but do not have the scale to hire employees.</p>

                <p>In Detroit, there are about 60 self-employed firms per 1,000 residents:</p>

                <ul>
                     <li>74% are owned by an African-American, 25% have white ownership, and 1% is owned by a member of another group.</li>
                    <li>African-American-owned self-employed businesses average about $14,000 in sales, compared to $32,000 for white-owned self-employed businesses in Detroit.</li>
                    <li>Among private businesses with employees,15% are owned by African- Americans, 78% have white ownership, and the remaining 7% fall under primarily Asian ownership.</li>
                    <li>White-owned businesses with employees average $2.4 million in revenues, African-American-owned businesses average $1.3 million in revenue, and businesses with “other” (primarily Asian) ownership average $600,000.</li>
                    <li>When businesses with and without employees are included, the average revenue of all private businesses in Detroit is about $300,000; within this, the average for white-owned businesses is $780,000, for Asian businesses, $240,000, and for African-American-owned businesses about $50,000.</li>
                </ul>

                The gap between white- and black-owned businesses in Detroit can largely be explained by the set of industries in which Detroit’s MBEs operate. MBEs across the United States tend to select less capital-intensive industries, and thus face lower overhead but also lower overall growth prospects than white-owned businesses.

                The selected industries are often oriented toward local rather than regional, national, or international markets; they also have higher failure rates.6 MBEs often select these industries because of their own work and business experience, but also because of lower levels of personal wealth than their white counterparts. MBEs also are more likely than their white counterparts to experience “real and perceived challenges in securing external capital.”

                Increasing the number and performance of MBEs must address short-term strategies to increase demand for the goods and services provided by MBEs, and provide assistance with business development and finance options. Longer-term strategies must increase minority participation in high-growth, capital-intensive sectors and address structural barriers to capital access.

                <h5>Land is Detroit's greatest &mdash; and most challenging &mdash; asset</h5>
                <p>
                    Land in Detroit is a potential asset for long-term economic development. Unlike in many U.S. cities, Detroit does not currently suffer from residential encroachment on job- producing land or face supply limitations that preclude growth in industrial sectors. However, the character, configuration, and spatial patterns of vacancy and neglect on formerly job-producing land represent a significant challenge to economic development in the city.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2010, vacancies accounted for 22% of Detroit’s industrial land, a portion that has likely increased with the further decline in manufacturing activity. Many of these sites are located along industrial corridors that have ceased to be competitive and now sit derelict and empty, contributing to and aggravating surrounding neighborhood blight. Of the sites that are located in more active and vibrant industrial areas— corridors with a “critical mass” of industrial activity—a significant portion consists of small, isolated, inaccessible, or oddly-shaped parcels with very limited potential for viable industrial or commercial redevelopment. More than 95% of the vacant industrial parcels in the city’s employment districts are less than one acre in size. The remaining parcels that are well-located and large enough to accommodate viable modern industrial development are often so blighted, contaminated, or in need of demolition that the anticipated costs can deter investment indefinitely.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The major challenge in addressing issues of blight and land assembly in the industrial areas is the patterns of ownership. Unlike in the city’s residential areas, where there is significant public ownership of sites, the overwhelming majority of land in the industrial and commercial areas is privately held. Public ownership of vacant or otherwise re-developable land in the industrial zones, for example, amounts to only 6.8% of the city’s total industrial land supply, with most of this found in residential parcels in Delray and formerly residential sites around the I-94 Industrial Park. With so few opportunities to assemble property directly from public agencies, and limited resources to outright acquire private property, other strategies must be considered to stimulate more productive use of vacant and vastly underutilized, privately held, commercial and industrial sites. The depth and breadth of challenges stemming from the condition, location, and configuration of Detroit’s job-producing lands will have to be met with a variety of strategies to improve the quality, availability, and productivity of private and public commercial and industrial land.</p>
