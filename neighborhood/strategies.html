            <h4>Strategies and implementation</h4>

            <h5>Moving from conditions today to more desirable neighborhoods for all</h5>

            <p><strong>How to use this chapter:</strong> The Neighborhoods Element of the Detroit Strategic Framework draws from and supports the Land Use Element. Like the Land Use Element, the Neighborhoods Element articulates a range of options for existing and new types of land uses (focused, in this case, on residential neighborhoods). The Neighborhoods Element extends the discussion toward quality-of-life measures and the performance of neighborhoods, in recognition that community and technical experts will need to engage in participatory planning and ongoing, fine-grained evaluation to strengthen, create, and sustain Detroit’s neighborhoods in ways unique to each and every one. Such collaborative work will require patience, time, and significant investment resources from many sectors, including government, nonprofit groups, neighborhood organizations, philanthropic organizations, business leaders, social support systems such as schools and service providers, and cultural groups.</p>

            <p>The following pages describe citywide and neighborhood-based strategies to address the quality-of-life issues Detroit residents face. There are five major neighborhood types: Urban Mixed-Use, Urban Live+Make, Urban Green, Traditional Neighborhoods, and Alternative Use. Within each neighborhood type, a map shows where these neighborhoods will be located in the 50-year land use horizon. Associated with each neighborhood type is a series of strategies organized around addressing the quality-of-life issues specific to that neighborhood, and also intended to help neighborhoods achieve their vision for a vibrant and more sustainable future. The prioritized quality-of-life elements for each neighborhood type were developed through a combination of the civic engagement outreach and the planning expertise of the technical planning team. The strategies reflect public comments collected from a vast array of civic engagement tactics as well as precedents, best practices, and current initiatives within the community. Creating priorities for each neighborhood type helps focus limited resources to best address the quality-of-life issues specific to each type of neighborhood. Through the civic engagement process, it also became evident that certain quality-of-life issues are universal to all parts of the city. These issues—including public safety, education, prosperity/income, and physical condition, among others—are addressed under a full list of strategic interventions in the citywide strategies.</p>

            <p>For each neighborhood type, a two-part illustration depicts (1) the necessary
            steps to stabilize that neighborhood, and (2) the strategies that can transform
            that neighborhood to achieve a vision for a better future. Stabilization strategies
            are geared towards stemming the tide of population loss and degradation of
            a neighborhood’s physical condition. Stabilization strategies within a specific
            neighborhood should be used in combination with citywide strategies that
            address public safety and improve education to have the greatest immediate
            impact. Strategies that transform neighborhoods are geared toward improving
            quality of life by building on the unique assets, resources, and community capacity
            associated with a particular neighborhood. The strategies for both stabilization and transformation are supplemented with current initiatives and proposed pilot projects that are well aligned with the overarching quality-of-life goals of the neighborhood. Many of the tactics necessary to improve quality of life in the city are already being tried and tested, but the Detroit Strategic Framework seeks to leverage these initiatives and expand their application to other neighborhoods when they are proven successful. Each neighborhood type has a Development Types Table that lays out which framework zones and development types are most compatible with that neighborhood. For instance, in a Live+Make neighborhood, the most appropriate form of residential development is limited to the adaptive reuse of industrial buildings for new multi-family residential uses; new single-family housing development would not be in keeping with the vision for the neighborhood typology. However, within a Live+Make neighborhood, there is a wider array of industrial and landscape uses possible in order to encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. This development prioritization can help community development organizations, public leadership, and private developers steer resources to the most appropriate areas of the city to improve quality of life.</p>

                <h5><a name="a"></a>A. Address quality of life challenges that affect all Detroiters</h5>

                Certain challenges facing Detroit’s neighborhoods cut across all parts of the city. They include public safety, education, health, and city services. While there may be specific place-based strategies to address these issues in specific neighborhoods, a larger set of coordinated strategies must be developed to address these challenges on a citywide scale. Similarly, effective strategies developed in one neighborhood hold the potential to benefit neighborhoods across the city. <strong>The citywide strategies represent the full range of recommendations that could be applied within Detroit’s neighborhoods.</strong> Many of these recommendations came directly from Detroit residents and neighborhood organizations who witness the challenges to their neighborhoods on a daily basis. This set of strategies contains the seeds of change to improve quality of life across all neighborhoods that will need further development as the Detroit Works Project moves into implementation

            <section id="2">
                <h5><a name="b"></a>B. Create dense, walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods</h5>

                <strong>Urban mixed-use neighborhoods</strong> seek to leverage employment districts to create higher- density, mixed-use residential communities. Growth in these areas builds on the economic engine of medical centers, universities, industry, and corporations to catalyze future residential, retail, and economic development. These areas include the Central Business District, Midtown, New Center, and the McNichols corridor. <strong>The character of these districts is shaped by the major cultural and institutional assets within them, including high-quality parks and public spaces, museums, theaters, stadiums, and schools.</strong> Urban Mixed-Use districts are the hubs of a regional transit network that can connect the city to the larger region, state, and Detroit Metropolitan airport.

                <h5><a name="c"></a>C. Regenerate neighborhoods through a fusion of art and industry</h5>

                <strong>Urban live+make neighborhoods</strong> are built from functionally obsolete industrial areas within the city. The spaces afforded by former industrial buildings allow for their creative reuse for a wide range of entrepreneurial and artistic uses. Residential lofts may be incorporated into the redevelopment, but <strong>the focus of the district is on entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, leading to new forms of business, production, art, and lifestyle.</strong> Open space on the fringes of these districts provides opportunity for research or artistic exploration and events. These areas reinvent entrepreneurship for the 21st century within the space of discarded 20th century industry.

                <h5><a name="d"></a>D. Repurpose vacant land to create green neighborhoods</h5>

                <strong>Urban green neighborhoods</strong> take landscape as the predominant transformational development. These neighborhoods transform a perceived liability (vacant land) at multiple scales, from the individual side lot to interconnected greenways, integrating it with the residential fabric of the neighborhood. Central to these neighborhoods is the creation of a unified, neighborhood-scale vision for repurposing of its land and rebuilding community.

                <h5><a name="e"></a>E. Renew traditional neigborhoods</h5>

                <strong>Traditional neighborhoods.</strong> Today a large percentage of the city consists of traditional neighborhoods made up of detached single- family homes on tree-lined streets, and ringed by commercial corridors. However, many of these neighborhoods have lost some of their luster as residents have left, foreclosures have occurred, and the cost of maintaining the physical environment has placed a major burden on residents. Traditional Neighborhoods need improvements to their city systems and infrastructure to make them competitive with peer neighborhoods in the region. <strong>When transformation is achieved in these neighborhoods, by all appearances they will be competitive with their regional peers, but the means and methods to have achieved their transformation will be different.</strong>

                <h5><a name="f"></a>F. Utilize producive landscapes as a basis for a sustainable city</h5>

                <strong>Alternative use areas</strong> are areas that are
                anticipated to see declining population and the
                expansion of vacant land. Given the challenges
                associated with very high-vacancy, many people
                living in these areas would move to a safer, amenity-
                rich neighborhood if provided the opportunity. At
                the same time, many residents have a loyal devotion
                to their properties and larger communities. While
                the opportunity to rebuild these neighborhoods
                into what they were is no longer a possibility, action
                must be taken to improve the quality of life for 221 residents who will continue to live in these areas.
                <strong>These areas hold the potential for reinvention with new productive land uses, but the rights of existing residents must be upheld, with residents included in the process of reinvention, not imposed upon.</strong>
