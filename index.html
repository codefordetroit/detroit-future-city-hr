		<h3>The economic growth element</h3>

		<p>The Economic Growth Element proposes five strategies to grow Detroit&apos;s economy in a way that is equitable for all Detroiters, supports Detroit&apos;s economic sectors, and can attract new residents and businesses</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Support the Four Key Economic Growth Pillars that have already demonstrated promising job growth: education and medical employment (&ldquo;Eds and Meds&rdquo;), digital and creative jobs, industrial employment (both traditional and new technologies, large-scale and artisanal, manufacture, and processes), and local entrepreneurship.</li>
			<li>Use place-based strategies to create core investment and employment corridors, focusing on seven employment districts where job growth is already occurring.</li>
			<li>Encourage local entrepreneurship and minority-owned business.</li>
		 	<li>Improve education and skills development.</li>
		 	<li>Transform the city&apos;s land into an economic asset</li>
		</ul>

			<h4>Ideas</h4>

				<h5>1. A city of robust job growth  </h5>
				<p>Despite six decades of population loss, Detroit&apos;s future will be driven by its ability to increase employment in the city. Most discussions about Detroit&apos;s future to date have focused on land area and population. Yet if we compare Detroit with similar-sized cities, the number of jobs per resident is far more telling than the number of residents itself. Of the four cities closest in size to Detroit, only one has more residents, but all four have many more jobs and a higher ratio of jobs to residents. In fact, this is true for most American cities: only 5 of the top 100 cities have fewer jobs per resident than Detroit.</p>

				<p>It is true that Detroit&apos;s dramatic loss of population will call for reconfiguration and repositioning of its infrastructure and land assets to create a new city form of diverse neighborhood types and land uses that are easier to serve, The key to fiscal sustainability and a better quality of life for Detroit is not simply higher population, although population increases would be welcome. <strong>Increasing the ratio of jobs to residents will contribute to the financial stability of the city while creating economic opportunity for the city&apos;s residents.</strong></p>

				<h5>2. A city of equitable economic growth</h5>

				<p>Detroit&apos;s economic growth must be based on fairness and equity.
				Detroit&apos;s diversifying economy should be developed toward job growth for a variety of skill demands and business types. This approach will not only enhance equity, but will also foster growth by tapping under-utilized human capital, increasing local incomes and consumer demand, improving educational outcomes, and reducing fiscal, social, and human costs associated with poverty.1 More than half of Detroit&apos;s current employment base comes from four economic pillars that are well suited to creating jobs for people of all skills and backgrounds: education and medical employment (&ldquo;Eds and Meds&rdquo;); digital and creative jobs; industrial employment (both traditional and new technologies, large-scale and artisanal, manufacture and processes); and local entrepreneurship.</p>

				<p>Within each of these key employment &ldquo;pillars&rdquo;, job opportunities and professional growth should be cultivated for people with a variety of educational backgrounds, skills, and interests. For example, in Eds and Meds, the innovative capacity of all workers— from medical staff, faculty, and researchers to maintenance, kitchen, and housekeeping staff—should be utilized and rewarded. In the small-scale industrial sector, and especially in the food sector, shared production spaces can offer low-cost options for local entrepreneurs and more broad-based ownership or sharing of business assets. Shared creative space is certainly vital to the information exchange and resource sharing necessary in the creative/digital fields, and can open up opportunities for training and career development, especially among youth and among adults seeking to start a second career.</p>

				<p>A crucial step toward equitable job growth will also be the explicit recognition and dismantling of current barriers facing Detroit residents in terms of access to skills development and employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. In fact, those very barriers have forced many Detroiters into the informal economy as entrepreneurs, which in turn offers an opportunity to create new pathways to prosperity and job growth for an unknown number of sole proprietors who might one day be employers themselves. This is discussed in further detail in the Strategies section of this chapter.</p>

				<h5>3. A city of physically and strategically aligned economic assets</h5>

				<p>Detroit&apos;s economy does not require entirely new economic assets, but the physical and strategic alignment of existing ones. As in all successful cities, fostering economic strength and stability in Detroit will require a constant renewal and realignment of key business assets, education and workforce development, innovation potential, and infrastructure.</p>

				<p>On the side of land use and physical assets, tools such as zoning, public land disposition, incentives, and specific strategies can be used to promote concentrated employment districts as focal points around which to pool public, private, and philanthropic investment. The implications will be far-reaching and have the potential to improve the cost structure, innovative capacity, and competitive position of the city&apos;s businesses in regional, national, and international markets. Important efforts to create districts of economic activity already exist, most notably in the food cluster around Eastern Market and the education and health-related clusters in Midtown. Existing efforts must be supported and expanded to include Detroit&apos;s most important traditional and emerging economic strengths.</p>

				<p>Organizational linkages must also be strengthened and sustained among city government and neighborhoods, business support organizations, employers and employees, and businesses and their suppliers. Although too many key companies and organizations today are islands, physically, they have a strong interest in re- knitting the physical, social, and cultural fabric that made Detroit&apos;s economy great.</p>

				<h5>4. A leader in industrial activity</h5>

				<p>Across the country, many have come to realize the critical role of manufacturing activity in promoting and sustaining innovation, especially in clusters where product and process are tightly linked, such as high-end apparel and biotech.2 Detroit has a unique combination of educational and medical institutions, information technology companies, low-cost industrial land, and an &ldquo;industrial commons&rdquo; that support manufacturing and industrial activity of all kinds. Detroit also has a skilled workforce, managers with operations experience, and broad design and engineering expertise among its residents. with proactive and coordinated investment, Detroit can remain an innovative hub for production.</p>

				<p>In the food cluster, for example, Detroit has the assets and knowledge to lead in the design and production of urban farming tools. In the medical cluster, the Henry Ford Innovation Institute is focused on user-based innovation that translates insights from the city&apos;s medical practitioners into the next generation of surgical tools and medical devices. These are but two examples of the ways in which Detroit can build on its legacy of industrial activity, while creating new pathways to industrial and supporting jobs.</p>

				<h5>5. A city of regional and global economic assets</h5>

				<p>Detroit has a diverse base of businesses, organizations, and institutions that are essential to building and maintaining a competitive edge for southeast Michigan in the 21st century. Beginning more than a decade ago, many public, private, and philanthropic leaders recognized that economic decline in the city and region was not temporary but reflected a broader crisis in local economic assets and capabilities. These leaders and their organizations invested in the ideas, assets, institutions, and culture to enable growth in innovation-driven clusters like education and technology, while also remaking traditional economic clusters like food to better serve local needs. Huge investments were made in expanding the city&apos;s institutions and economy: The College for Creative Studies added major new buildings, an MFA program, and a high school; the Detroit Creative Corridor Center opened; Next Energy was founded; the education and medical institutions in Midtown became national models for maximizing local economic impact; Henry Ford Hospital opened an Innovation Institute to capture and commercialize the innovative capacity of medical practitioners; Wayne State University opened TechTown and announced a $93 million biotech hub; and a local son returned to Detroit with 7,000 workers and triggered a new wave of information technology growth in Downtown. Concurrently, local leaders remade traditional industries, including the Detroit Food Policy Council and Detroit Black Community Food Security&apos;s work in creating a vision for the national movement in food justice and food security issues. Local organizations such as New Economy Initiative and DEGC are working to promote local procurement and entrepreneurship opportunities across the city.</p>

				<p>Recently, the american automotive sector has revitalized, and the role of southeast michigan in global automotive research and development expanded. The automotive renaissance in the region is part of a larger story in which u.s. manufacturing has become more competitive globally. One of the country&apos;s most influential consultancies, boston consulting group (bcg), recently estimated that due to improved competitiveness, the u.s. is likely to add between 2.5 and 5 million jobs in manufacturing and support industries by 2020.</p>

				<h5>6. A city that supports minority business enterprises</h5>

				<p>Business ownership shapes the location of opportunity and power in an economy: Business owners strongly influence organizational practices such as hiring, wage setting, and procurement and often serve in positions of civic and social leadership. One reason minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) are so important to Detroit is that they are more likely to hire minority employees and utilize minority suppliers, thus increasing opportunity for a large number of Detroiters.</p>

				<p>Minorities in Detroit already account for 89% of the city&apos;s population; however, the firms they own account for only 15% of private company revenues. African- American-owned businesses account for 94% of the city&apos;s MBEs, yet few of these companies grow enough to hire even one employee: Only one in thirty African- American companies in the city has at least one employee compared to one in three white-owned businesses.</p>

				<p>These numbers reflect the enormous challenges to the MBE community in Detroit (as well as its potential). In a comparison of 25 U.S. cities, Detroit ranked seventh in African-American self-employment per capita. <strong>Strengthening business ownership in the city&apos;s largest population group is one of the best ways to grow businesses in the city.</strong></p>

				<h5>7. A city of immediate and long-ranging strategies for resident prosperity</h5>

				<p>Although Detroit has an urgent need to support and develop high-quality education and skills to prosper in the 21st century, there is little evidence for the oft-stated claim that &ldquo;Detroit can&apos;t fix its economy until it fixes K-12.&rdquo; <strong>In fact, improving education and increasing economic opportunity are complementary strategies: providing economic opportunities for Detroit&apos;s adults will improve fiscal conditions in the city, support the academic performance of their children, and create the incentives for children and adults alike to invest in education and skills development.</strong></p>

				<p>The dramatic downturn in the regional economy has curtailed opportunities for lower-skilled workers across the region. This opportunity gap must be addressed alongside the skills gap. In fact, the lack of job opportunities seems to have profoundly weakened the link between educational attainment and prosperity for Detroiters. Nationwide, high school graduation reduces the chance of living in poverty by 56%, and going on to earn a two-year degree reduces poverty by an additional 51%. Yet in Detroit, the corresponding reductions are much smaller (39% and 33%).</p>

				<p>Strategies to combat the city&apos;s poverty must acknowledge the need for a dual approach. Public, private, and philanthropic priorities should support a concurrent approach to the creation of new job opportunities along with educational improvements.</p>


			<h4>Strategies and Actions</h4>

				<h5>A. Support four key economic pillars</h5>

				<p>A strategy that targets the sectors of the economy that are most likely to generate broad-based economic growth will allow the public, private, and philanthropic sectors to align strategies and resources around economic growth &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; that can create jobs, foster economic opportunity and social equity, and best utilize the city&apos;s land assets. These opportunities fall into four broad categories: Education and Medical; Industrial; Digital/Creative; and Local Entrepreneurship.</p>

				<p>The most recent 30-year regional employment forecast for Detroit, developed by the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG), shows some employment growth in Detroit between 2010 and 2015, followed by a leveling off after 2015. For the entire 2010-2040 period, SEMCOG projects the entire Southeast Michigan regional economy will add 300,000 net new jobs, of which just over 7,000 will land in the City of Detroit. Although these projections provide an important sightline into the dynamics of the city&apos;s and region&apos;s economies, and can be used as a baseline for understanding future job growth, they suffer from an unavoidable flaw: They were developed assuming &ldquo;business as usual.&rdquo;</p>

				<p>The &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; projections do not account for or anticipate the potential impact of aligning future investments with existing major civic investments in the four pillar economic areas. Coupled with critical changes in the city&apos;s productive landscape— including the resurgence of the downtown district and the emergence of the city as a hub for digital and creative businesses—these investments indicate that continued, intentional investment in the Four Key Economic Growth Pillars will yield potent benefits.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions: </h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Align cluster strategies with the Detroit Strategic Framework.</li> 
						<li>Establish cluster-based collaboration with labor market intermediaries.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>B. Use a place-based strategy for growth</h5>

				<p>Seven specific employment districts have the greatest potential to unleash large- scale job creation in Detroit. These districts will promote a deliberate spatial pattern to business activity, generate multiple benefits to the economy, and help alleviate critical fiscal and social issues in the city. Reinvesting in specific employment districts will create the scale required for efficient investments in infrastructure and services; allow development of effective strategies for building demolition and land assembly; and create dense employment nodes that can facilitate transportation connections between Detroit residents and businesses, an issue that currently plagues the least-advantaged Detroiters but also employers who would benefit from a larger labor pool with more reliable transportation options. This concept will have a secondary (but critical) effect of raising property values in the employment districts, thus reducing the required subsidy for new construction and creating conditions to support private real estate activity.</p>

				<p>These efforts will rely on an alignment among all levels of government (city, state, federal), the private sector, and the philanthropic community. Many in the private sector have voiced support for concentrating economic activity, with the understanding that it will increase the feasibility and efficiency of private-sector attempts to address shortcomings in the existing operating environment. Some private companies already pool resources to fund shared security and emergency services. Concentrating activity would make these investments more efficient and could create conditions for private-public-philanthropic partnerships to address other critical issues like transportation linkages between residents and employment opportunities. To help target resources and develop effective infrastructure, land use, and worker-support policies, each employment district will require a menu of strategies and investments tailored to the opportunities they present.</p>

					<h6>Implementation Actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Align public, private, and philanthropic investments in employment 	districts.</li>
						<li>Develop detailed action plans for primary employment districts. </li>
						<li>Encourage industrial business improvement districts (IBIDS).</li>
						<li>Become a national leader in green industrial districts.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>C. Encourage local entrepreneurship and minority business participation</h5>

				<p>As many Detroit leaders have recognized, growing the base of the city&apos;s entrepreneurs is a great opportunity for employment and wealth creation. Opportunities for the self-employed and small businesses are likely to increase over time: Nationally, employment growth has been fastest in those parts of the economy that serve local markets rather than national and international (&ldquo;traded&rdquo;) markets. These opportunities will grow as consumers turn increasingly to local products and larger national and international companies continue to outsource secondary functions, such as building and facilities maintenance. These are significant but often overlooked opportunities. For example, the Local Business Services cluster (&ldquo;Local B2B&rdquo;) in Detroit employs about 25,000 people (including self-employed) and could employ thousands more if local demand for these services was met by Detroit-based companies. The opportunities that exist in Detroit today can support different forms of enterprise, self-employment, small business ownership, and scaling of existing businesses.</p>

				<p>The local business clusters are also a good opportunity to diversify the city&apos;s base of businesses. Many of the opportunities in the local clusters do not require large amounts of start-up capital, yet offer proximity to a large and broad base of customers. Moreover, some of the infrastructure to support these initiatives has already been built. The Midtown educational and medical institutions are national leaders in identifying opportunities for local suppliers, and DEGC has started a multi- year Local B2B initiative to increase local opportunities in this cluster. Broadening and deepening existing efforts and identifying new opportunities could lead to the creation of thousands of jobs in the city.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Promote short-term approaches to increase the number and success of MBEs and DBEs in the City.</li>
						<li>Support the development of low-cost, shared spaces for clusters with high levels of self employment.</li>
						<li>Provide young Detroiters with exposure to and experience in Digital / Creative and other new economy clusters.</li>
						<li>Develop a comprehensive long-term strategy to increase and strengthen 	the City&apos;s MBEs.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>D. Improve skills and support education reform</h5>

				<p>Skills building and education reform are key factors driving economic growth in Detroit. Even more important, they shape opportunity, incomes, and quality of life for Detroiters. Although the Framework does not discuss K-12 reform, the strategies here will complement K-12 improvement in the city&apos;s public schools by increasing high school graduation rates and improving the value of two-year degrees held by Detroiters; better linking the needs of employers with workforce training investments, a direction already underway among the city&apos;s workforce training providers and community colleges; increasing training opportunities for degreed Detroiters already in the workforce; developing strategies to address challenges faced by African American high school graduates nationally in securing full-time employment opportunities;8 and in general, increasing overall opportunities for Detroiters by better linking residents to Detroit jobs as well as overcoming challenges with physical access to workforce opportunities by better aligning employment and training locations with residential areas in the city.</p>

				<p>This approach attempts to increase the opportunities and means for Detroiters to improve their education and skills levels, then reward these investments with job opportunities, career paths, and higher wages. The approach recognizes that education and skills are the primary determinants of economic quality of life and must be matched with opportunities to utilize these skills and be rewarded.</p>

					<h6>Implementation Actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>&ldquo;Hire Detroit&rdquo;: Strengthen local hiring practices.</li>
						<li>Link workforce investments to transportation.</li>
						<li>Coordinate workforce development best practices.</li>
						<li>Revitalize incumbent workforce training.</li>
						<li>Expand public-private partnerships for workforce development.</li>
						<li>Commission a study to identify levers to improve graduation rates and poor labor market outcomes of Detroiters.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>Land regulations, transactions, and environmental actions</h5>

				<p>The condition, location, and configuration of Detroit&apos;s job-producing land presents many challenges that are critical to address in order to generate economic activity and jobs for all Detroiters. The regulation of land in employment districts can have far-reaching impacts, including blight reduction, improved safety, and ultimately a surge in private investment.</p>

				<p>A critical opportunity lies in developing and popularizing organizational and funding mechanisms for &ldquo;clean and safe&rdquo; programs to dramatically improve the character and security of Detroit&apos;s industrial and commercial zones and employment centers. Perception is reality, so focusing on the look and feel of key employment areas is essential to their success. Branding and character campaigns can also dramatically improve the allure of certain areas to specific economic clusters, while conceptual site and district planning exercises can help brokers and developers to concretely envision the potential of an area and plan for land assembly as appropriate. In addition, attention to the natural environment will create modern and green employment districts that improve the health of workers and nearby residents.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Create an industrial side-lot program.</li>
						<li>Create a priority permitting process for employment districts.</li>
						<li>Focus on land banking industrial and commercial property.</li>
						<li>Identify alternative capital sources for real estate development. </li>
						<li>Articulate a reverse change-of-use policy.</li>
						<li>Create master-planned industrial hubs.</li>
						<li>Address underutilization of industrial building space and land.</li>
						<li>Address weaknesses in the local brokerage sector.</li>
					</ol>

		<div class="land">
		<h3>The land use element</h3>

		<p>Land is Detroit&apos;s greatest Liability and its greatest asset. The preoccupation with what to do with all that land has driven the discussion about land use and led to oversimplified strategies. In fact, Detroit&apos;s population density is still similar to that of cities like Portland, Atlanta, and Denver. To be sure, a traditional &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; approach is not going to work for Detroit.</p>

		<p>Detroit&apos;s image and identity have evolved through three major eras, each tied to a particular aspect of the city&apos;s economy. First, the early period of riverfront trade and commerce set the tone for downtown&apos;s majestic Beaux Arts buildings and formal street pattern. Then as the city grew during the Auto Age, an extensive industrial ring grew up around the city core. New modes of industrial production decentralized the city still more, with a combination of rail and highways serving the sprawling outer reaches of Detroit. During the third phase of Detroit&apos;s identity, large neighborhoods of single-family detached homes spread out across the city. Once a sign of the American Dream, these neighborhoods were never as efficient to serve as more mixed-use, compact neighborhoods would have been. Both the neighborhoods, and the over-scaled systems that serve them, fell on hard times as the city lost population and revenue.</p>

		<p>This plan outlines a fourth idea for the city: A stronger, greener, and more socially and economically vital Detroit, where neighborhoods feature a wide variety of residential styles from apartments to houses, and where residents are connected to jobs and services by many transportation options (and especially a regional network of transit) in a &ldquo;canvas of green&rdquo; that features stately boulevards, open green space, urban woodlands, ponds and streams, and new uses of natural landscape to clean the air, restore ecological habitats, and produce locally sourced food. Such a Future Detroit will not have a single &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; pattern with one downtown, but many centers and neighborhoods that each have a distinctive identity and a character all their own. One of the newest and most ambitious aspects of this change will be the network of productive and working landscapes that actively maintain a higher quality of public health for Detroit, while offering beauty and a wholly new way to experience an urban environment. detroit actually has the opportunity to lead the region in creating a new urban form, becoming a model for other north american cities. Here, in the midst of tremendous challenge, is the opportunity to transform the city&apos;s form and function in new and exciting ways.</p>

		<p>Some initial efforts can start immediately, through small- or large-scale demonstration projects. A sustained and sustainable transformation of Detroit calls for even more: connected land use and design strategies that stimulate economic growth, align city systems, provide open space, and strengthen neighborhoods, supported by an entirely new framework for decision making and regulation that can respond rapidly to business opportunities, urgent public health needs, and the imperative of job growth and residents&apos; quality of life. The Strategic Framework&apos;s new physical vision for the city taps the potential of Detroit&apos;s land-rich environment, supports existing areas of growth and stability, and sets forth specific recommendations for serving current residents where they live and work right now.</p>

			<h4>Ideas</h4>

				<h5>1. A city of multiple employment districts</h5>

				<p>The strategic Framework&apos;s employment-district strategy addresses the key economic issue in Detroit: not the size of the city&apos;s physical footprint, but the scale of the city relative to current levels of economic activity and job and business growth. By promoting focused growth in seven districts, the city can create employment levels typically associated with more prosperous cities, while creating viable strategies for addressing the physical deterioration, limited services, and aging infrastructure across the city.</p>
				
				<p>Each district will have a unique scale and character suited to its function and existing or potential assets, development pattern, and building styles. For example, the McNichols corridor will leverage its institutional assets, including the University of Detroit-Mercy, Marygrove College, Sinai-Grace Hospital, and Wayne County Community College, to expand Eds and Meds employment opportunities, attract employees to live in the area, and improve a diverse range of neighborhoods abutting the corridor from the historic University District to the creation of new multi-family apartment buildings directly fronting McNichols and Palmer Park.</p>

				<h5>2. A city connecting people to opportunity</h5>

				<p>A new network of transportation corridors will connect employment centers to neighborhood districts, allow for new bicycle routes and bus rapid transit corridors, reinforce economic and neighborhood centers, and provide a range of infrastructural services in sustainable natural landscapes that filter stormwater (blue infrastructure) and clean the air of transportation and industrial emissions (green infrastructure). existing proposals for enhanced transportation systems in Detroit can be modified to create a transformed network that connects people to jobs and services within the city and to employment centers beyond the city limits. The transformed network needs to respond to today&apos;s metropolitan region while actively contributing to the planned growth of employment districts and localized needs within the city. The key principle behind the transformation is the creation of a clear hierarchy of corridors, ranging from high-capacity and high- speed arterials and highways to intermediate thoroughfares, and lower-capacity neighborhood strips with frequent stopping services. Transportation networks will be conceived in concert with planning for retail amenities and services at the regional and residential scale, with neighborhood-level transportation routes designed as &ldquo;complete streets that allow bicycling, walking, and a broader range of approaches to getting places.</p>
				
				<p>Efficient movement of goods and waste in and through Detroit is key to the economic and environmental health of the city. For freight as well as personal transit, the interchanges between hierarchy tiers or different modes of transportation are as important as the routes that run between them. The type of interchange required will have an important impact on the land use in that area. A transit interchange will offer a range of higher-density land uses that can offer services to those passing through. A freight interchange may require large amounts of space and therefore should be considered for areas expected to stabilize at lower residential densities or even change land use altogether.</p>

				<h5>3. A green city where landscapes contribute to health</h5>

				<p>Unlike other cities pressed to find space for transformative landscapes, Detroit has an abundance of available land resources that can be leveraged to create a new green and sustainable city unlike any other in the world. <strong>Landscape has enormous potential to structure or foster social and cultural relationships through adapted and productive ecologies that will give rise to a new urban form.</strong></p>

				<p>Landscapes are inevitable: If you do nothing else, landscape will re-establish itself even in the most built-up areas. Relative to other forms of infrastructural or urban development, then, landscape strategies are very affordable. Landscapes also adapt well to different conditions, so they can require different types and lower intensities of maintenance to sustain them.</p>

				<p>Landscapes are productive and multi-functional. They clean air and water and soil; they make urban environments healthier; and they generate food, jobs, energy, commerce, and habitat. In this way, they cultivate new kinds of urban landscapes and experiences. They are also effective grounds for research and experimentation. New ideas can be safely and effectively tested in landscape settings for later application across the city and in other cities like Detroit.</p>

				<p>Landscapes are the original &ldquo;green&rdquo; land use: they can reduce the resources necessary to sustain the city. Landscapes enrich communities by improving the health of the environment and of the people in it, and also create a lush, rich image and identity for the city—one which competing cities would love to have.</p>

				<p>Because they work most effectively across large scales, with the ability to connect and coordinate seemingly unrelated entities, landscapes also have the potential to reconnect Detroit with its regional context. Landscapes of this type are already in place in Detroit, including the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor, Detroit RiverWalk, and Belle Isle.</p>

				<h5>4. A city of distinct, attractive neighborhoods</h5>

				<p>Detroit has room to offer many neighborhood types and lifestyle choices for residents who want to stay in the city, while welcoming new residents looking to make detroit their home. To achieve this, a series of traditional and innovative neighborhood typologies have been established to directly engage existing challenges within the city, and to leverage the strengths and assets of existing neighborhoods and places with unique characteristics. Guiding the development of these neighborhoods are a series of development targets and performance measures to define neighborhood goals and measure their success in meeting those goals—which are in turn tied to the goal of a high quality of life for all residents.</p>

				<p>While Detroit&apos;s traditional neighborhoods offer a compelling starting point for this transformation, many other areas—some of which are not necessarily recognized as viable neighborhoods today—offer a significant long-term opportunity for Detroit to be a leader in establishing a new urban form.</p>

				<p>For Detroit, this new urban form includes areas in which vacant and underutilized land and defunct industrial building stock provide the material for innovative residential environments. Green residential and green mixed-rise neighborhoods transform existing land vacancy into integrated landscapes, providing recreational, ecological, and productive functions. Mixed-use neighborhoods for living and making not only transform parts of Detroit&apos;s unutilized industrial and residential areas, they also capitalize on Detroit&apos;s production philosophy, where ideas are developed, and become real.</p>

			<h4>Strategies and Actions</h4>

				<h5>A. Create a citywide framework for growth and investment</h5>

				<p>The public, private, and philanthropic sectors need a tool to assess the city&apos;s land use conditions and 104 develop strategic approaches to investments that will improve quality of life across all parts of the city. Based on comprehensive research and analysis of the physical and market conditions of the city, the Framework Zones map will help assesses the condition of Detroit&apos;s districts and neighborhoods in terms of degrees of vacancy, from low to moderate to high. From this fact-based mapping, decision makers from city leaders to neighborhood organizations have the ability to take a more strategic approach to the opportunities and challenges facing neighborhoods, and to place those challenges in the context of the city at large. The discussion of vacancies in this broad, citywide context does not attribute &ldquo;strength&rdquo; or &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; to neighborhoods only on the basis of vacancy: Every neighborhood within the city is at risk, and every effort needs to be made to stabilize and transform the existing conditions to improve quality of life in all parts of the city.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Establish framework zones and future land use maps as the basis for public, private, and philanthropic investment.</li>
						<li>Base land use decisions on the fundamental physical and market conditions of the city: low-vacancy, moderate-vacancy, high- vacancy and Greater Downtown areas.</li>
						<li>Update framework zones map on a 5-year basis to reflect changes to physical and market conditions.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>B. Support a network of new and existing neighborhood types</h5>

				<p><strong>The Detroit strategic framework introduces a new set of land use typologies that combine to represent the future land use vision for the city, from traditional forms that now characterize detroit to entirely new departures.</strong> These are organized in three major categories: Neighborhoods, Industry, and Landscape. Each typology is scaled to the district or neighborhood level, and includes a range of strategic interventions and development types to support the larger vision for Detroit&apos;s new form. In addition to more conventional land use typologies, such as Traditional Residential Neighborhoods or General Industrial Districts, the Detroit Strategic Framework introduces new typologies that repurpose vacant land or obsolete industrial areas for innovative or productive uses, such as Innovation Ecological landscapes and Live+Make districts.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

						<li>Establish land use typologies as the vision for the future city.</li>
						<li>Reorganize land use around neighborhoods, industry, and landscape.</li>


				<h5>C. Introduce new forms of development</h5>

				<p><strong>Areas of high, moderate, and low-vacancy all hold the potential to be assets in the reinvention of the city.</strong> As part of the land use vision, the Detroit Strategic Framework posits two key points regarding development: First, not all development can occur in all places; and second, new forms of development can affirm the city&apos;s assets and address existing physical conditions. New residential and commercial development must reinforce areas of strength and increase densities there. At the same time, areas with significant population loss and high degrees of vacancy can be the sites of new, innovative, and productive development types that improve quality of life for city residents.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Align framework zones and future land use typologies to determine appropriate locations and types of development across the city.</li>
						<li>Introduce new and innovative landscape- based development types.</li>
						<li>Introduce form-based development criteria.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>D. Create a new and diverse open space system for the city</h5>

				<p><strong>Landscape, open space, and environmental systems are envisioned as a new, healthy, green, and productive structure for the city of Detroit.</strong> Large-scale ecological and productive landscapes will take the place of vacant lots, and begin their work cleansing the water, the air, and the soil, all the while putting people to work. They also become a center for improving public health, sustaining Detroit&apos;s rich mix of cultures, and strengthening social connections in neighborhoods and across the city.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Implement blue and green infrastructure.</li>
						<li>Encourage reuse of vacant land with productive landscapes.</li>
						<li>Diversify park network.</li>
						<li>Encourage partnerships between universities and firms in productive landscapes to conduct research and provide job training opportunities.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>E. Redefine corridors and create complete streets</h5>

				<p>Similar to its residential land, Detroit&apos;s commercial and transportation corridors have seen massive disinvestment over the last 50 years. The city&apos;s reduced population has left its roadways oversized for the population they serve. The space left behind holds the potential for rethinking the city&apos;s corridors. In fact, we cannot afford to continue to think of transportation and other city systems as &ldquo;mono- functional&rdquo;—Detroit has the opportunity and the imperative to combine many services and functions in repurposed corridors that can accommodate different types of transit, bicycling, and walking. Doing so will create a network of &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; that offer an efficient set of transportation options and also address the need for green space and high-quality street design. Excess space within the right-of-way can accommodate blue infrastructure such as swales to collect stormwater run-off. Within areas of low-vacancy, land can be assembled in nodes to create walkable retail districts or new residential development that reinforces adjacent neighborhoods.</p>	

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Develop tiered transit network that ties into regional system.</li>
						<li>Incorporate multi-modal transit design into all street improvements.</li>
						<li>Focus commercial development in walkable nodes or auto-oriented strips based on physical/market conditions and future land use vision.</li>
						<li>Implement green infrastructure along highway corridors.</li>
						<li>Implement blue infrastructure along arterial and other roads.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>F. Enact innovative regulatory reform</h5>

				<p>The overlay of Framework Zones, land use typologies, and development types provide the basis for a revised regulatory framework that the City of Detroit should formally adopt. The City&apos;s anticipated adoption and codification of the Detroit Strategic Framework will also call for multiple layers of policy guidance documents within City departments and other public agencies, so that they can align implementation with the citywide vision for Detroit&apos;s new image. The Detroit Strategic Framework also offers an important opportunity to  provide a fully coordinated basis for regional and state decision making about land use and public investment, recognizing the importance of the city within a larger regional, state and national context.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Phase land use vision over 3 horizons (stabilize/improve, sustain, transform).</li>
						<li>Revise/amend City Master Plan of Policies and Zoning Ordinance.</li>
						<li>Update public, private, and philanthropic policy guiding documents.</li>
					</ol>

		<h3>The city systems element</h3>

		<p><strong>Renewing and realigning for the new Detroit.</strong> From streetlights and utility networks to waste management and transportation, Detroit&apos;s city systems sustain its residents and businesses—but in turn must be sustained by revenues from these users. Yet population and employment loss, and the resulting loss of revenue and disinvestment, have left Detroiters paying more for less.</p>

		<p>Even though Detroit&apos;s economy is growing in new sectors—such as information technology, finance, communications, and design—the city will likely continue to lose some population over the next 20 years. Reorganizing the city&apos;s systems now is critical to meeting the needs of Detroiters who have been paying and waiting for a better day, as well to match and support the future Detroit of connected, diverse neighborhoods and employment centers that encourage new jobs and new neighbors. The city&apos;s government, private utility operators, civic and business leaders, and residents face big decisions about improving services while reducing costs, closing an overwhelming budget gap that has burdened the city for decades, and reshaping an over-scaled, underinvested infrastructure into an efficient, environmentally sustainable set of 21st century systems. If we confront these tough decisions now, we can improve the quality of life for Detroiters and put the city back on the path to financial security within 10 years.</p>

		<p><strong>Reconciling and replenishing.</strong> Realigning Detroit&apos;s city systems is not just important for the sake of efficiency: It is a matter of justice for all. The most economically vulnerable households in Detroit are also the hardest hit by system inefficiencies that harm their health as well as their pocketbooks. In particular, air pollution from industry and car exhaust have contributed to high rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases, especially among children.</p>

		<p>Transportation holds an important key to creating a socially and economically just Detroit. The Detroit of today is a driver&apos;s city, without enough transit or other transportation choices, and with many jobs well beyond the city limits. The very people who need jobs most are left behind, struggling with transit routes that don&apos;t connect them to work, or sharing an old car along with all the upkeep. Detroiters who can&apos;t afford a car are also cut off from fair access to healthy food, recreation, health care, and a whole range of necessities for a healthy, balanced life.</p>

		<p>The urgency of addressing environmental degradation and residents&apos; quality of life reaches far beyond city limits. Regional economies, transportation, and water and air quality issues connect Detroit to the entire Great Lakes ecosystem. Traditional infrastructures and industry tend to degrade resources, with regional consequences. New alternative forms of infrastructure, using landscape to clean air and water, can restore environmental balance and improve quality of life and the environment in Detroit and in the entire Great Lakes basin.</p>

		<p><strong>Shaping the city to suit real needs.</strong> The Detroit we now live in was designed for nearly 2 million people, and the extra capacity in city systems is not only going to waste, it actually creates a drag on services for the current residents. Just as we can find new ways to manage the abundance of land in the city, we can unlock innovations to manage surplus system capacity and reallocate resources to upgrade and maintain core systems, improve service, and heal the environment. Systems renewal will be coordinated with land use change to better relate neighborhoods and employment districts, as well as the systems that serve them.</p>

		<p>The key is to be smart about how and where we locate and reinforce residential areas, employment, and other activities. These decisions must be balanced with the development Detroit has now, and especially with the knowledge that some residents will continue to live in areas that have high-vacancy. The Strategic Framework foresees how the city can evolve from its present pattern— which is spread out and hard to serve—toward a city of connected neighborhoods where employment, residences, and activities are all close by, or are connected in an efficient system of high-speed transit routes and green, landscaped boulevards. Some areas of the city that have already moved away from residential land use will be suited for new land uses and development types, including new green infrastructure that works to clean the air and water and support the health of the whole city and region. Services will be scaled to the number of people and uses in each area of the city.</p>

		<p><strong>System transformation.</strong> Three major transformations underpin the change in Detroit&apos;s systems—strategic renewal of infrastructure to suit demand, deploying surplus land as a form of infrastructure (radically changing the image of the city in the process), and changing the culture of transportation (to enhance connections and minimize environmental impact).</p>

		<p>The goal of reconfiguring services is to continue to providing core services— including water, sewerage, gas, electricity, and communications services—to all Detroiters wherever they work and live, while also serving all the needs for existing and growing businesses. Delivering the change that has escaped the city in the past will require coordinated effort among all system providers, public and private. This coordination will need to be planned and carried out from a central point of accountability, in order to transform the city&apos;s infrastructure and service quality.</p>

			<h4>Ideas</h4>

				<h5>1. Strategic infrastructure renewal</h5>

				<p><strong>Differentiated and reliable investment.</strong> The Strategic Framework proposes a differentiated level of investment across the city, aligning infrastructure capacity to Detroit&apos;s future form and continuing to serve people where they live and work now. The potential benefits for economic development and cost reduction are significant, but cannot be achieved instantly. Instead, each area of the city will need an approach to investment that provides certainty and predictability so that systems agencies, businesses, civic groups, and residents can make long-term plans. Moving to a situation where more people live in higher-density areas and fewer people live in lower-density areas (a more efficient distribution) is a critical step in reducing the financial problems faced by service providers and end users.</p>
				
				<p><strong>System differences and integration.</strong> The five key systems of water, waste, energy, transportation, and communications each have specific issues arising from their installation and ownership history, as well as their unique technical aspects. A proposed investment approach for each area of the city should be coordinated with land use and should prioritize how systems are upgraded or replaced over time. Although each system has its own peculiarities, coordinating the investments in related systems can provide significant efficiencies across all the systems.</p>

				<h5>2. Landscape as 21st Century Infrastructure</h5>

				<p>Landscape is an opportunity to address Detroit&apos;s critical environmental issues and public health hazards. In particular, blue and green infrastructures are landscapes that cleanse stormwater and improve air quality, respectively. Traditional infrastructural systems are typically focused on delivering only one service at a time, often at the expense of the environment and public health. By contrast, landscape infrastructures serve many functions by providing habitat, offering recreation opportunities, enhancing transportation options through bicycling and walking, and improving neighborhoods by providing beauty and increasing property values—all while serving a practical, environmental function such as retaining or cleansing stormwater.</p>
				
				<p>Landscape systems typically cost less to build and maintain than conventional infrastructure, creating an economic benefit. Landscape infrastructures offer opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration across agencies, permitting them share or coordinate personnel and budgets in ways that are not possible for conventional infrastructure projects. These systems will have regional ecological benefits, including improved water quality in the Rouge and Detroit Rivers and Lake Erie, as well as increased and improved habitat for local wildlife and migrating birds.</p>

				<h5>3. Diversified transportation for Detroit and the region</h5>

				<p><strong>Applying new technology to existing roads.</strong> The transportation system—especially Detroit&apos;s fixed road network—must be substantially reconfigured to suit the currently smaller population within the city, and will also have to adapt to suit emerging needs within the city and region. Because Detroit is also central to the support system for a freight hub of national and global significance—the busiest North American commercial border crossing, and a significant freight employer in its own right—the creation and upgrading of freight routes into and through Detroit need consistent, long-term support. At the same time, residents urgently need more transportation choices beyond driving.</p>

				<p>New technologies can be integrated into Detroit&apos;s transportation network to serve both commercial and personal transportation. Mobile devices (including cell phones) can be used by users and operators to manage on-demand services that match capacity to demand, improving efficiency and allowing smaller fleets to serve the same number of people. Modest adjustments to the existing road network will greatly facilitate the integration of new technology. The very size of Detroit&apos;s existing roads also offers an opportunity to make change with significantly less disruption than in a fast-growing city.</p>

				<p><strong>Addressing the distance and density challenges.</strong> A key challenge in Detroit is how spread out the city is, compared with cities of similar population. The relatively low density and long distances between employment and neighborhoods, coupled with how many commute out from the city every day, will challenge the city and region to devise strategies to increase transit access and use. Bringing more jobs within reach of public transit is only part of the answer. Overhauling the operational practices of the region&apos;s transit providers is the other part. Encouraging and supporting greater use of cycling and walking represents a low-cost way to support system-wide change in transportation with a relatively small investment. Key changes will be the development of a ‘greenway&apos; network to promote cycling and walking, introduction of bus rapid transit (BRT) operations on main travel routes (within and beyond the city limits), and improved intermodal transfer for passengers and freight.</p>

			<h4>Strategies and Actions</h4>

				<h5>A. Reform delivery system</h5>

				<p>Detroit&apos;s infrastructure renewal strategy addresses the need to allocate limited funds both spatially in the city—where people work and live right now—and temporally over the next twenty years, to encourage new residents and new business. This will mean upgrading network capacity in priority employment centers and neighborhoods, while reducing capacity where there is little or no demand. All investments must be guided by a clear plan that removes uncertainty around future city development and demonstrates the maximum possible cost savings for each dollar spent up front.</p>

				<p>Reforming system delivery also means coordinating investment among all of the private and public partners involved, to prevent them from acting without reference to one another, which in turn could prevent them from duplicating efforts or making unnecessary expenditures. It also means being aware of the technical or social constraints and special needs of each particular area, so that restructuring the city is not only cost-effective but also still serves residents&apos; needs.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Use the framework plan to create certainty around residential and employment density in each area of the city.</li>
						<li>Right-size systems so that network capacity matches residential and employment demand for each area in the medium term.</li>
						<li>Balance investment in areas of greatest need with investment in areas of greatest potential.</li>
						<li>Address equity: ensure that a good standard of core services are provided to all groups in all areas including high-vacancy areas.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>B. Create landscapes that work</h5>

				<p>Although the City of Detroit only accounts for 12.9% of the total Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) service area, investing in blue infrastructure within Detroit (rather than elsewhere in the region) is a valuable opportunity for the city</p>

				<ul>
					<li>to emerge as a leader in sustainable water management strategies and technologies;
					<li>to enjoy the multiple benefits blue infrastructure offers to a city (visual amenities, increased property values, and neighborhood stabilization);
					<li>to capture funding opportunities that exist regionally (Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funds, and other grants).
				</ul>

				<p>Additional benefits of blue infrastructure include flood mitigation, improved water quality and stream channel health (better for fish and other aquatic life), and recreational opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>Green corridors are proposed as forest buffers that absorb carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and pollutants emitted into the air from vehicular exhaust, industrial uses, or infrastructure facilities. Improved air quality has health benefits for residents who live nearby and can provide a unique setting to attract new businesses.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Deploy surplus land as multifunctional infrastructure landscapes, primarily addressing flood water mitigation and air quality.</li>
						<li>Bring health and social benefits associated with landscapes and green facilities to lower income groups with poor access to transportation.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>C. Reconfigure transportation</h5>

				<p>Detroit&apos;s transportation systems must be realigned to better serve the emerging	needs of the future city. For example, the existing road network has significantly more space than it requires to meet current and projected traffic demand. At the same time, there is a shortage of non-motorized transportation networks for people to walk and cycle on. Paths that do exist are disjointed and less valuable than if they were connected in a single network, particularly for freight efficiency.</p>

				<p>Detroit&apos;s transit system is in need of major reform to establish bus rapid transit (BRT) links between the main employment centers in the metropolitan area and to orient other transit types as feeders. These faster routes will offer access to a wider range of employment opportunities for Detroiters than at present, and will improve cross-town connections. During initial stages, the proposed adjustments to the network can be made at little or no additional cost. Some changes simply require a different mode of operation using the same fleets and roads—such as designating new express bus routes as a precursor to BRT or light rail. Others can be implemented on a rolling basis so that large up-front costs are avoided. The transportation network (roads and railways, as well as the vehicles that circulate on them) is as important to quality of life as it is to accessing work, services, education, and business opportunities. In addition, Detroit&apos;s strategic location on national and international networks makes transportation improvement a potentially important industry in its own right.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Realign city road hierarchy to provide faster connections between employment, district, and neighborhood centers.</li>
						<li>Enhance transit service and increased ridership by realigning transit system to provide integrated network based on fast connections between regional employment centers, supported by feeder services from residential areas.</li>
						<li>For higher-vacancy areas, provide smaller-scale, flexible on-demand services.</li>
						<li>Align pattern of development in centers and neighborhoods to support greater number of walking and cycle trips, including promotion of greenways.
						<li>Support freight and logistics industries through upgrade of key routes and provision of enhanced connections across the border to Canada.</li>
						<li>Provide large-scale multimodal freight interchange facilities to support local industry and overall city logistics role.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>D. Enhance communication access</h5>

				<p>The information and communication technology industry (in its wireless incarnation)is sufficiently young that it has not suffered from the decline in Detroit&apos;s population in the same way as the other city systems. Telecoms and data companies are, in fact, still expanding their coverage of the city. In this context, Detroit has an opportunity to harness the latest technology for monitoring and real-time balancing or optimizing of city systems. On top of the management of the hard systems there are real benefits available to the delivery of public services through e-governance  programs. This is quite apart from the critical support that super-fast data systems provide to some of Detroit&apos;s fastest growing industries.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Ensure high-speed data networks are in place to serve existing and new economic sectors and wider community.</li>
						<li>Develop e-government platform to maximize efficiency of social service delivery.</li>
						<li>Utilize improved data network to develop smart infrastructure systems which deliver improved service with smaller capacity infrastructure.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>E. Improve lighting efficency</h5>

				<p>Of all the public services at stake in Detroit&apos;s changing population and land use patterns, public lighting is one of the most potent symbols of the scale of decline in city infrastructures. This being the case, the Public Lighting department has embarked on an ambitious plan to both rationalize the number of active lamps in the city and to upgrade them to low-energy fittings. This has the potential to be developed further to align to the land use changes set out in the Strategic Development Framework plan. Significant organizational and financial changes— including the establishment of a separate Public Lighting Authority (PLA) to contract out maintenance and operation to a third party—are also being considered to improve service delivery and unlock funding for investment.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Reduce number of lights and upgrade all remaining lights to low-energy LED type.</li>
						<li>In high-vacancy areas, take some parts of the network off-grid, using solar power for generation.</li>
						<li>Transfer ownership of the network to a new Public Lighting Authority which can procure services from the private sector competitively.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>F. Reduce waste and increase recycling</h5>

				<p>Detroit&apos;s waste collection and management system is linked to the era of centralized production and distribution. New technologies for collecting and processing, along with restructured form of the city, offer opportunities to decentralize and optimize the city&apos;s waste management system. By linking waste management with transportation adjustments and land use changes, Detroit can become cleaner and more efficient. In particular, Detroit could recycle much more of its waste and develop more rigorous recycling programs.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Reduce total levels of waste through citizen education and work with packaging industry.</li>
						<li>Develop targeted and citywide curbside recycling program.</li>
						<li>Ensure that incinerator emissions remain at or below US EPA standards and international best practice.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>G. Actively manage change</h5>

				<p>Each of the city system providers has been challenged by the restructuring of the city. Developing a successful response to the challenges will greatly depend on effective coordination among system operators. Such an approach to system consolidation will open up opportunities for a wider number of stakeholders to achieve efficiency and integration of services and systems. These opportunities can be understood as interdependencies (where streamlining one system facilitates operational efficiencies for another), indirect benefits (improving quality of life and environmental justice through more efficient use of space and resources), and interagency agreements (by-products of one system can be used by another).</p>

				<p>The regulatory issues that impede effective interagency operation should be tackled, and an interagency platform established to facilitate the kind of coordinated planning that the city will need if it is to move forward from its current predicament. Although distinct, these proposals are linked because one of the best ways to structure change is via the requirements of each agency to file an annual capital investment budget for state approval. Thus, mandated levels and forms of service could be varied to align each system with the others.</p>
				
				<p>Several regulatory changes to support interagency cooperation have been proposed in the past, yet have not been adopted by the city. These changes deserve renewed emphasis. Examples of this are the creation of a Regional Transportation Authority to allow for integrated public transportation policy and funding, adjustment of the current road funding mechanism (Act 51) to meet the future needs of the city, and the creation of a new Public Lighting Authority able to buy its energy from multiple suppliers and outsource maintenance contracts if necessary.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Adopt Strategic Framework Plan as basis for systems transformation and put in place rolling review program.</li>
						<li>Create an interagency platform to coordinate change across public and private sector bodies.</li>
						<li>Communicate with affected communities and monitor processes for emerging success and unforeseen adverse impacts.</li>
					</ol>

		<h3>The neighborhood element</h3>
			<h4>Ideas</h4>

				<h5>1. A city of many key assets </h5>

				<p><strong>Neighborhood parks, educational institutions, centers for medical innovation, an iconic skyline, historic neighborhoods, and an unmatched international riverfront: Detroit has the foundational assets that make cities attractive.</strong> At the center of this are the assets woven within the city&apos;s neighborhoods, where families come together, communities are fostered, and dynamic life thrives. These include majestic trees, inherent civic capacity, neighborhood organizations, retail, churches, parks, recreation centers, schools, and cultural centers. Detroit must find a way to support these important places and qualities while cultivating an environment in which many more can be established through the capacity of Detroiters. To get there, resources must be strategically focused so that the investments will benefit all residents. In creating and sustaining such assets, the quality of life for Detroiters can improve as the city&apos;s attractiveness to potential new residents grows.</p>

				<h5>2. A city of neighborhood choices</h5>

				<p>Smaller cities may be defined by one prevailing neighborhood type, or a center within which the majority of the population lives. Large-scale cities such as Detroit can provide a wider array of neighborhood choices. Unfortunately, today, Detroit has not fulfilled that opportunity. Although each neighborhood choice may not appeal to every household, each household should be able to find a neighborhood choice that suits it. One of Detroit&apos;s most unique and powerful potential strengths is its potential to provide a range of regionally competitive neighborhoods to attract and retain a greater number of residents. This is important because Detroit continues to lose residents to other nearby cities.</p>

				<p>The strategies put forth in this element of the Strategic Framework show how to address specific existing challenges and leverage inherent strengths to create a range of neighborhood choices. These include traditional neighborhoods (low and medium density), neighborhoods of mixed use and higher density (neighborhood center, district center, and city center), new neighborhoods for urban living and making (art and artisanal, clean-industry innovation, and live+work entrepreneurship), and new neighborhoods for urban green living (green residential and green mixed-rise). While stabilizing and strengthening a number of Detroit&apos;s existing neighborhoods and mixed-use areas will contribute to a collection of attractive, well-known neighborhood types, it is within the new neighborhood typologies that Detroit may transform existing liabilities of vacancy, abandonment, and disinvestment into new dynamic urban areas for living that reinvigorate unused or overlooked assets to create completely new neighborhood models, establishing Detroit as a leader in urban revitalization and design.</p>

				<h5>3. A city of different strategies for different neighborhoods</h5>

				<p>Strategies used to strengthen and reinforce existing neighborhoods, and new neighborhoods for urban living, must be as diverse as the quality-of-life elements they seek to improve. To achieve this, each strategy must be defined by specific existing conditions, the range of possible future neighborhood typologies associated with those conditions, and the overall quality of the objectives being given priority. Beyond that, each potential strategy must be effectively coordinated to ensure its broad viability and impact across the city. Detroit can no longer withstand well-intentioned investments that may benefit one neighborhood, while ultimately undermining the viability of others.</p>

				<p>Within this model, the range of potential implementers, from residents to institutions, can customize specific tactics to achieve their goals, operating within a common framework for decision making, linking overall objectives for land use, economic growth, and city systems with strategies tailored to achieve specific results. This allows each strategy to address the unique needs, capacity, and assets of each neighborhood to maximize the impact of investment and effort.</p>

				<h5>4. A city of diverse housing types for diverse populations</h5>

				<p>Thriving contemporary cities are hallmarks of diversity, including employment options, income, ethnicity, social interests, and individual expertise. Within this context, Detroit must provide a diverse array of housing types to appeal to a range of people and households. At the height of the automotive boom within Detroit and its region, the single-family home came to dominate the city&apos;s housing spectrum, creating housing stock that has limited the city&apos;s ability to meet current market demand for greater multi-family housing.</p>

				<p>To be viable and sustainable, Detroit&apos;s neighborhoods now need to provide a wider choice of housing types. The Detroit Strategic Framework coordinates neighborhood strategies with existing conditions and future typology objectives to create strategic, targeted housing rehabilitation, renovation, and new construction across multiple neighborhood types, including traditional neighborhoods; mixed- use centers; and new, innovative neighborhood types such green mixed-rise, green residential, and live+make. The breadth of these neighborhood typologies provides a platform for creating a variety of housing options.</p>

				<h5>5. A city of residents who engage in their own futures</h5>

				<p>Many Detroit residents are recognized, active participants in their future. They have long done for themselves what others could not, and they have been an integrated part of the planning process for the Detroit Strategic Framework. The process has capitalized on the insight, capacity, and commitment of all Detroiters to realize a comprehensive decision-making framework. The means and methods for achieving the substantial transformative strategies identified within the process will require no less integration and engagement with all Detroiters— residents and civic leaders—ensuring a voice for everyone. Residents bring with them a localized expertise that adds unmatched value to integrated strategies for investment. To ensure residents have the opportunity to participate in their future, the Detroit Strategic Framework provides a comprehensive framework for decision making that will facilitate better, more informed coordination for all residents. This includes continuing to facilitate neighborhood dialogue regarding how neighborhoods can use the Framework and its strategies, making sure that important strategies being used in one neighborhood can create a better- performing city at large.</p>


			<h4>Strategies</h4>
				<h5>A. Address quality of life challenges that affect all Detroiters</h5>

				<p>Certain challenges facing Detroit&apos;s neighborhoods cut across all parts of the city. They include public safety, education, health, and city services. While there may be specific place-based strategies to address these issues in specific neighborhoods, a larger set of coordinated strategies must be developed to address these challenges on a citywide scale. Similarly, effective strategies developed in one neighborhood hold the potential to benefit neighborhoods across the city. <strong>The citywide strategies represent the full range of recommendations that could be applied within Detroit&apos;s neighborhoods.</strong> Many of these recommendations came directly from Detroit residents and neighborhood organizations who witness the challenges to their neighborhoods on a daily basis. This set of strategies contains the seeds of change to improve quality of life across all neighborhoods that will need further development as the Detroit Works Project moves into implementation.</p>

				<h5>B. Create dense, walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods</h5>

				<p><strong>Urban mixed-use neighborhoods</strong> seek to leverage employment districts to create higher- density, mixed-use residential communities. Growth in these areas builds on the economic engine of medical centers, universities, industry, and corporations to catalyze future residential, retail, and economic development. These areas include the Central Business District, Midtown, New Center, and the McNichols corridor. <strong>The character of these districts is shaped by the major cultural and institutional assets within them, including high-quality parks and public spaces, museums, theaters, stadiums, and schools.</strong> Urban Mixed-Use districts are the hubs of a regional transit network that can connect the city to the larger region, state, and Detroit Metropolitan airport.</p>


				<h5>C. Regenerate neighborhoods through fusion of art and industry</h5>

				<p><strong>Urban live+make neighborhoods</strong> are built from functionally obsolete industrial areas within the city. The spaces afforded by former industrial buildings allow for their creative reuse for a wide range of entrepreneurial and artistic uses. Residential lofts may be incorporated into the redevelopment, but <strong>the focus of the district is on entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, leading to new forms of business, production, art, and lifestyle.</strong> Open space on the fringes of these districts provides opportunity for research or artistic exploration and events. These areas reinvent entrepreneurship for the 21st century within the space of discarded 20th century industry.</p>
				

				<h5>D. Repurpose vacant land to create green neighborhoods</h5>

				<p><strong>Urban green neighborhoods</strong> take landscape as the predominant transformational development. <strong>These neighborhoods transform a perceived liability (vacant land) at multiple scales, from the individual side lot to interconnected greenways, integrating it with the residential fabric of the neighborhood.</strong> Central to these neighborhoods is the creation of a unified, neighborhood-scale vision for repurposing of its land and rebuilding community.</p>

				<h5>E. Renew traditional neighborhoods</h5>
				
				<p>Today a large percentage of the city consists of traditional neighborhoods made up of detached single- family homes on tree-lined streets, and ringed by commercial corridors. However, many of these neighborhoods have lost some of their luster as residents have left, foreclosures have occurred, and the cost of maintaining the physical environment has placed a major burden on residents. Traditional Neighborhoods need improvements to their city systems and infrastructure to make them competitive with peer neighborhoods in the region. <strong>When transformation is achieved in these neighborhoods, by all appearances they will be competitive with their regional peers, but the means and methods to have achieved their transformation will be different.</strong></p>

				<h5>F. Utilize productive landscapes as the basis for a sustainable city</h5>

				<p><strong>Alternative use areas</strong> are areas that are anticipated to see declining population and the expansion of vacant land. Given the challenges associated with very high-vacancy, many people living in these areas would move to a safer, amenity-rich neighborhood if provided the opportunity. At the same time, many residents have a loyal devotion to their properties and larger communities. Whilethe opportunity to rebuild these neighborhoodsinto what they were is no longer a possibility, action must be taken to improve the quality of life for residents who will continue to live inthese areas. <strong>These areas hold the potential for reinvention with new productive land uses, but the rights of existing residents must be upheld, with residents included in the process of reinvention, not imposed upon.</strong></p>

		<h3>The land and buildings assets element</h3>

		<p>Vacant land and buildings are among Detroit&apos;s most valuable assets for its future. While in the abstract this may seem reasonable, to those dealing with these properties it is difficult to internalize. The sheer magnitude of the inventory, the difficulties of maintaining it, the obstacles to reuse, and the limited resources affecting every public agency in the city are all barriers to recognizing the untapped potential of the city&apos;s public land inventory. The challenge does not stop at public land: In fact, far more vacant and underutilized properties remain in private rather than public ownership.</p>

		<p>Turning vacant land from burdens to assets will take more than changes in specific policies and practices. <strong>All public agencies—whether city, county, or state—will need to change how they think about land, and make equally fundamental changes to the way they acquire, manage, and dispose of land and buildings, and the way other public agencies regulate them.</strong> Without such a change in thinking and practice, the inventory of vacant land and buildings in its current condition will not only fail to become an asset, it will continue to act as a roadblock to the implementation of creative strategies for land use, environmental restoration, economic growth, and neighborhood revitalization.</p>

		<p>If public land is to become an asset, all of the different public agencies that hold land need to align their missions around a single shared vision—not only a vision for &ldquo;better land management,&rdquo; but a vision that reflects the aspirations for the city as a whole, as expressed in its land use and environmental plans, economic growth strategies, and neighborhood revitalization efforts. Within these plans and strategies, public land plays a critical role. Indeed, without a coordinated, strategic approach to the acquisition, disposition and reuse of public land, none of those strategies can come to fruition.</p>

		<p>A transformative strategy is about more than the parcels in public ownership themselves. It also must provide an integrated approach to land and buildings across the entire city. A truly transformative strategy for land repurposing, redevelopment, and management will demand that the City look at its regulations governing vacant land and problem properties in private ownership, and how those regulations and their enforcement help or hinder the achievement of Detroit&apos;s revitalization goals. It calls for rethinking the county&apos;s tax foreclosure practices, to better link them to strategies of acquisition and disposition of public land; and for aligning decisions about public facility siting, reuse, or closures with public land decisions, as well as with the larger land use, environmental, and economic growth strategies being pursued by the City of Detroit.</p>

			<h4>Ideas</h4>

				<h5>1. A city that shares a vision: coordinating the management of vacant land</h5>

				<p>Public land and facility strategies must be aligned with the City&apos;s strategies for neighborhood revitalization, economic growth, and creation of blue/green infrastructure, while the activities of each of the public landholding entities as well as other public agencies must be grounded in a single coordinated strategic framework.</p>

				<p>We need to begin thinking of properties in public ownership and those in private ownership as part of a single system. All land, whatever its legal ownership, is public in the sense that how it is used and maintained affects its neighbors and the community as a whole, and affects the city&apos;s ability to preserve its neighborhoods and build its economy. More important than who actually owns the inventory is how it fits into the vision for the city. Detroit needs to develop a coordinated system in which all entities operate consistently across all aspects of public land management and private land regulation, making decisions based on clear policy goals and principles, and utilizing available legal and financial tools as efficiently as possible. Wherever title to any single parcel resides, that parcel should be seen as being part of single inventory, guided by a single set of policies and goals.</p>

				<p>Such a profound change in thinking and procedures will not be easy. The transformation of Detroit&apos;s approach to its land will require many separate agencies, with separate missions and priorities, to subordinate their differences to a common direction and purpose, and to foster unprecedented connections among landholding, regulatory, and user agencies. In the long run, public landholding agencies and those leading the city&apos;s regeneration should explore realignment of responsibilities, including reducing the number of separate entities holding title to public parcels, to increase the system&apos;s efficiency and take better advantage of the legal and technical capacities of particular agencies.</p>

				<h5>2. A city where everything is connected: viewing vacant and problem properties within one interrelated system</h5>

				<p>Detroit contains an estimated 150,000 vacant properties, roughly 2/3 vacant land parcels and the rest vacant buildings. Of these, the eight public landholding entities control about 66,000, or well under half. In addition, the city contains an unknown number of problem properties that are still occupied, including underutilized, poorly maintained industrial buildings and many absentee-owned houses and small apartment buildings suffering from neglect.</p>

				<p>Historically, the respective systems designed to deal with publicly owned and privately owned properties have not been integrated. The latter is managed as a regulatory function, and has regrettably suffered from the lack of resources that burdens many of Detroit&apos;s systems. Many ordinances are on the books, but are poorly or intermittently enforced, with too few personnel to keep up with the volume of properties.</p>

				<p><strong>Decisions about vacant land and problem properties, whether in public or private ownership, need to be made through a single lens:</strong> How will these properties be treated, so their outcomes will benefit the city by stabilizing neighborhoods, fostering economic growth, and creating opportunities for new infrastructure and innovation, rather than continue to act as a drag on the city&apos;s future?</p>

				<h5>A city of strategic approaches: recognizing the uniqueness of each property&apos;s value and challenges</h5>

				<p>A coordinated approach to addressing Detroit&apos;s vacant land must begin with a strategic approach to addressing the land in public ownership to maximize the city&apos;s ability to create long-term value and enhance community amenities and quality of life through its use and reuse. <strong>This approach must be grounded in a basic principle: Vacant land is not fungible—each property has its own problems, and its own potentials.</strong> Every decision a public agency makes about land has strategic implications; this applies to the following areas:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Property acquisition, including establishing policies about which properties should be added to the public inventory;</li>
					<li>Property disposition, including determining the most appropriate reuse, identifying suitable buyers, and selecting the most appropriate disposition methods;</li>
					<li>Property holding strategies, including when properties should be held for long-term public purposes, for assembly into more buildable or marketable sites, or for future reuse potential;</li>
					<li>Maintenance of public land; and</li>
					<li>Demolition of vacant structures</li>
				</ul>

				<p>All decisions about public land, from acquisition to disposition, should be made on the basis of strategic principles designed to lead to the best results for the city from that decision.</p>

				<h5>A new urban landscape: using land for infrastructure  and innovation</h5>

				<p>Many people in Detroit, as elsewhere, still think of reuse of vacant land as equivalent to redevelopment of new buildings to replace the ones that have been torn down. Yet the reality is that, outside certain key locations, continuing demographic and economic trends mean that little new development will take place in Detroit for many years. <strong>This is a challenge, but also a great opportunity. It means that Detroit&apos;s vast inventory of vacant land can be used for a variety of new purposes, to foster innovations in public open space, urban agriculture, clean energy, and more; and to build a new network of blue/green infrastructure to divert stormwater from the city&apos;s overtaxed sewer system and clean the city&apos;s air.</strong></p>

				<p>Pursuing this idea also demands a change in attitude toward the large areas of vacant land that cover many parts of the city. Rather than seeing this land as largely worthless, and being eager to unload it to any willing private party, the public sector should see this land as being of value, and of creating large, contiguous tracts where current holdings may be substantial but fragmented. This, in turn, calls for greater emphasis on holding rather than selling public land, and on making it more costly for private entities—often speculators—to hold onto vacant parcels instead of using them productively or relinquishing them.</p>

				<p>It also requires us to think about the smaller lots in traditional neighborhoods not as necessarily future infill sites, but as long-term open spaces in those neighborhoods, and to ensure that they are used in ways that strengthen, rather than undermine, the fabric of those areas.</p>

				<p>Finally, it calls for an open-minded, creative approach to innovation and experimentation. The sheer scale of the vacant land available creates the opportunity to try out different reuse alternatives, some of which may be new and largely untried. Both through its land use regulations and its disposition policies, the City should encourage the full range of ideas for reuse of vacant land in ways that hold promise to further the city&apos;s revitalization and enhance its quality of life.</p>

				<h5>A city where public facility investments count: aligning public facilities with land use transformation</h5>

				<p>Much of the public land inventory in Detroit is made up of public facilities, including public schools, parks, recreation facilities and community centers, police substations, and more. Those facilities are an important part of the ‘glue&apos; holding the city&apos;s neighborhoods together, and defining the quality of life in those neighborhoods. Today, as a result of declining population and financial resources, many of those facilities, particularly school buildings, have been closed, and many 271 others, including many of the city&apos;s parks, fall short of their promise. Population and fiscal constraints are realities that cannot be wished away, but a different approach can be taken within those constraints to integrate decisions about public facilities into larger decisions about Detroit&apos;s future land use.</p>

				<p>Decisions about public facilities are being made in Detroit every year—whether to close a facility or invest money in upgrading it, whether to close a park or reduce its ongoing maintenance, where to consolidate public facilities and services, how to reuse vacant facilities, and more. Each of these decisions affects far more than the facility itself. <strong>Going forward, all such decisions should be aligned with the larger strategies governing the future of the neighborhoods and other areas in which they are located, so that their outcomes enhance the stability of neighborhoods slated for revitalization, or help further the conversion of others areas into blue/green infrastructure or other non-development reuses.</strong></p>

			<h4>Strategies and Actions</h4>

				<h5>A. Target vacant public land and buildings in employment districts for emplyoment growth</h5>

				<p>Detroit has strong assets for economic growth, yet is held back by the shortage of ‘move-in&apos; buildings and shovel-ready buildable sites into which local firms can expand, and new firms from outside Detroit can locate. The strategic reuse of public land holdings—coupled with an aggressive strategy to make private land speculation more costly—may be the critical element in Detroit&apos;s ability to realize its economic growth potential. By positioning publicly and privately owned vacant land in and around economic growth employment districts for assembly and reuse, Detroit can level the playing field to compete with suburban greenfield development opportunities.</p>
				
				<p>Detroit needs a series of highly focused strategies to create sites that can be marketed on short notice to potential users, as well as to create opportunities for existing firms to grow their businesses. These strategies fall into three broad categories:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>strategic acquisition and assembly of properties to create desirable and buildable sites;</li>
					<li>targeted disposition of properties to developers and end users around specific economic development goals, while holding properties for further assembly; and</li>
					<li>strategies to increase the cost of holding vacant land and buildings by private owners, while fostering the greater use of underused industrial and commercial buildings.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>These strategies are detailed in the next section on using land assets for economic growth.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Identify strategic targets for acquisition of properties by public entities.</li>
						<li>Adopt policies for targeted disposition and holding of properties in economic growth areas.</li>
						<li>Increase the cost of holding vacant property.</li>
						<li>Adopt program to foster greater use of underused buildings.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>B. Use vacant public land as a tool for neighborhood stabilization.</h5>

				<p>While not the only factor threatening the stability of Detroit&apos;s vital yet at-risk residential neighborhoods, the proliferation of vacant lots and empty buildings scattered around those areas are a significant force blighting these neighborhoods and accelerating their decline. Factors contributing to blight include the inadequate maintenance that many lots receive, difficulty in putting them back into neighborhood-enhancing reuse, housing vacancy and abandonment, and the continued proliferation of privately owned vacant lots and problem buildings. Targeted strategies for these sites can minimize their blighting effect and turn them into neighborhood assets.</p>

				<p>High priority must be given to actions to remove existing blighting elements in at- risk neighborhoods, and to the extent possible, prevent future blighting elements from appearing. Specific strategies that should be pursued include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>systematically reusing vacant lots in ways that contribute to neighborhood stability, such as community gardens, side lots, and other landscape treatments to create attractive low-maintenance environments;</li>
					<li>expeditiously recycling vacant and abandoned houses for reoccupancy where feasible, or demolition where reoccupancy is not feasible;</li>
					<li>adopting regulatory programs and incentives to motivate more responsible ownership by absentee landlords; and</li>
					<li>increasing the cost of holding vacant land and buildings by private owners.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>All of these actions should be planned and implemented through partnerships among city agencies, neighborhood associations and community development corporations, to leverage the energy and human resources that these organizations are willing and ready to bring to stabilize and rebuild their neighborhoods.</p>

				<p>These activities should be coordinated closely with other neighborhood stabilization activities, including steps to increase public safety, foster greater home ownership, and build stronger neighborhood organizations.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Reuse vacant lots to enhance neighborhood stability.</li>
						<li>Adopt targeted demolition strategy based on stabilization priorities.</li>
						<li>Address problem landlords.</li>
						<li>Increase the cost of holding vacant property.</li>
						<li>Pursue targeted neighborhood stabilization strategies.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>C. Transform largely vacant areas through blue and green infrastructure</h5>

				<p>Large parts of Detroit are dominated by vacant land and buildings with little or no short-term or medium-term development potential, but with the ability to be turned into valuable assets for the city through a variety of green reuse alternatives. Today&apos;s largely unmanaged, chaotic vacant land environment in these areas contributes to the sense of neglect felt in many parts of the city, undermining the quality of life not only for the residents of these areas, but for the city as a whole.</p>

				<p>Perhaps the most dramatic potential for transformation lies in the use of public land for blue/green infrastructure; that is, reuse of land to absorb stormwater and divert it from the city&apos;s sewer system, or to clean the air and improve community health. Reusing vacant land in these ways can save the city hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in sewer upgrading costs while creating landscaped and maintained marshes, lakes, greenways, and forests that will remove blight, enhance their surroundings while linking them to the rest of the city, and potentially create future market value and redevelopment opportunities.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Hold land between interstates/industrial areas and neighborhoods for green infrastructure (do not release for future residential development).</li>
						<li>Acquire available land for blue infrastructure in key locations.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>D. Link public facility and property decisions to larger strategies.</h5>

				<p>In recent years, many schools, parks, recreation centers, police substations, and other public facilities have been closed as Detroit adjusts to new fiscal and demographic realities. Some have been used for other purposes, while many sit vacant. At the same time, Detroit Public Schools has built, expanded, or upgraded other school facilities. Decisions about which facilities should be closed, or where services or maintenance should be reduced or enhanced, as well as the reuse of vacant facilities, should be guided by the City&apos;s land use and neighborhood stabilization goals, in order to maximize the value of existing facilities and reduce the blighting effect of vacant buildings and the potential destabilizing effect of future closings. At the same time, the presence of a number of new or significantly upgraded school facilities represents an important opportunity for neighborhood stabilization. Targeted neighborhood strategies around new or significantly upgraded schools, along with co-location of other community-serving activities can maximize their value as neighborhood assets while enhancing the quality of life in the surrounding area.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Create priority system for public land and parks acquisition.</li>
						<li>Create joint policies and system for disposition of public property.</li>
						<li>Adopt coordinated maintenance strategy for public land.</li>
						<li>Adopt targeted demolition strategy based on stabilization priorities.</li>
						<li>Use new and upgraded schools as community anchors for stabilization.</li>
						<li>Review criteria for school closing to reflect neighborhood stability factors.</li>
						<li>Update parks and recreation facilities planning to reflect current and future populations and budgets (update aspects of 2006 Strategic Master Plan by the DRD).</li>
						<li>Parks and recreation planning at neighborhood scales: refine citywide strategy of Detroit Strategic Framework through smaller-scaled analysis.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>E. Incorporate more innovative vacant land maintenance strategies</h5>

				Only a handful of the thousands of vacant sites in Detroit are likely to see redevelopment—in the sense of new buildings—over the next decade or more. As demolitions continue to take place, the number of vacant parcels is likely to grow. If there is one central question that must drive the entire discussion of public land, it is this: how can one transform these thousands of parcels from their current status, where they blight neighborhoods and form barriers between communities, to a new status in which they become assets, enhancing rather than blighting their surroundings, and linking rather than separating the different parts of the city?

				While vacant land today fragments the city, isolating neighborhoods from one another, it can become a vehicle for re-knitting the city&apos;s fabric. The secret lies in giving a central role to the use of landscape in its many forms and variations, as laid out elsewhere in this Framework as the vehicle for transforming vacant land into a productive part of the urban environment, whether with respect to ongoing maintenance, short-term holding uses, or long-term reuse for purposes such as stormwater management, urban agriculture, carbon forests, and more. Landscape needs to become a central rather than a peripheral element in Detroit&apos;s toolkit of urban land uses. This is as true in neighborhoods—where many scattered vacant parcels need to be integrated into the community fabric through sensitive landscape treatments—as in high-vacancy areas, where large-scale uses for vacant land are needed.

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Adjust city maintenance standards, strategies, and practices to vary by framework zone and future land use (do not mow all vacant lots in city regardless of location, but instead adopt different lower-cost maintenance strategies in different areas); look for partnerships to help with land maintenance.</li>
						<li>Form partnerships with community groups and other organizations, businesses, and individuals to help maintain land.</li>
						<li>Refine set of landscape maintenance typologies and develop cost estimates to implement.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5>F. Use more aggressive regulative tools</h5>

				Well over half of the vacant properties in Detroit are privately owned, including the great majority of the city&apos;s vacant buildings. No vacant property strategy that focuses entirely on the publicly owned inventory, yet fails to address the private inventory, can hope to be transformative for the city&apos;s future. In addition to vacant properties, large numbers of occupied but poorly maintained properties, often owned by short-term speculators, are destabilizing the city&apos;s neighborhoods, while rising numbers of properties—vacant and occupied—are appearing on the county&apos;s annual tax auctions. More aggressive, targeted strategies to address these challenges need to be an integral part of the public land strategy.

				The City needs to establish clear standards for maintenance of vacant properties by private owners, and use its regulatory authority aggressively to increase the cost of doing business for those owners who do not maintain their properties to the full required standards. Restructuring and effectively enforcing existing vacant property ordinances is an important first step. A second priority should be strategies to motivate responsible landlord behavior and penalize speculators who do not maintain their properties, a critical issue in many neighborhoods where 283 more and more formerly owner-occupied houses are falling into the hands of absentee owners. Finally, the tax foreclosure process, through which thousands of properties move through a revolving door of speculation, foreclosure, and ultimate abandonment, needs to be addressed.

				Neighborhood associations and CDCs need to be full partners with the public land agencies in designing and carrying out these strategies. Not only do these agencies lack the resources to tackle the problem on their own, but many of Detroit&apos;s neighborhood associations and CDCs are actively seeking opportunities to take responsibility for the future of their neighborhoods. Only by tapping their energy— not merely in carrying out City initiatives, but by playing a strong role in framing and designing those initiatives—will Detroit have a realistic chance to succeed in finding new purposes for its vacant land.

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Increase the cost of holding vacant property.</li>
						<li>Address problem landlords.</li>
						<li>Create formal partnership with Wayne County Treasurer for tax foreclosure auctions.</li>
