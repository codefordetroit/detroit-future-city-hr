			<h4>Introduction</h4>

		<div class="span6">
		<p>Land is Detroit&apos;s greatest liability and its greatest asset. The preoccupation with what to do with all that land has driven the discussion about land use and led to oversimplified strategies. In fact, Detroit&apos;s population density is still similar to that of cities like Portland, Atlanta, and Denver. To be sure, a traditional &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; approach is not going to work for Detroit.</p>

		<p>Detroit&apos;s image and identity have evolved through three major eras, each tied to a particular aspect of the city&apos;s economy. First, the early period of riverfront trade and commerce set the tone for downtown&apos;s majestic Beaux Arts buildings and formal street pattern. Then as the city grew during the Auto Age, an extensive industrial ring grew up around the city core. New modes of industrial production decentralized the city still more, with a combination of rail and highways serving the sprawling outer reaches of Detroit. During the third phase of Detroit&apos;s identity, large neighborhoods of single-family detached homes spread out across the city. Once a sign of the American Dream, these neighborhoods were never as efficient to serve as more mixed-use, compact neighborhoods would have been. Both the neighborhoods, and the over-scaled systems that serve them, fell on hard times as the city lost population and revenue.</p>

		<p>This plan outlines a fourth idea for the city: A stronger, greener, and more socially and economically vital Detroit, where neighborhoods feature a wide variety of residential styles from apartments to houses, and where residents are connected to jobs and services by many transportation options (and especially a regional network of transit) in a &ldquo;canvas of green&rdquo; that features stately boulevards, open green space, urban woodlands, ponds and streams, and new uses of natural landscape to clean the air, restore ecological habitats, and produce locally sourced food. Such a Future Detroit will not have a single &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; pattern with one downtown, but many centers and neighborhoods that each have a distinctive identity and a character all their own. One of the newest and most ambitious aspects of this change will be the network of productive and working landscapes that actively maintain a higher quality of public health for Detroit, while offering beauty and a wholly new way to experience an urban environment. detroit actually has the opportunity to lead the region in creating a new urban form, becoming a model for other north american cities. Here, in the midst of tremendous challenge, is the opportunity to transform the city&apos;s form and function in new and exciting ways.</p>

		<p>Some initial efforts can start immediately, through small- or large-scale demonstration projects. A sustained and sustainable transformation of Detroit calls for even more: connected land use and design strategies that stimulate economic growth, align city systems, provide open space, and strengthen neighborhoods, supported by an entirely new framework for decision making and regulation that can respond rapidly to business opportunities, urgent public health needs, and the imperative of job growth and residents&apos; quality of life. The Strategic Framework&apos;s new physical vision for the city taps the potential of Detroit&apos;s land-rich environment, supports existing areas of growth and stability, and sets forth specific recommendations for serving current residents where they live and work right now.</p>

			<h4>Ideas</h4>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
		<div class="span6">
				<h5><a name="1"></a>1. A city of multiple employment districts</h5>

				<p>The strategic Framework&apos;s employment-district strategy addresses the key economic issue in Detroit: not the size of the city&apos;s physical footprint, but the scale of the city relative to current levels of economic activity and job and business growth. By promoting focused growth in seven districts, the city can create employment levels typically associated with more prosperous cities, while creating viable strategies for addressing the physical deterioration, limited services, and aging infrastructure across the city.</p>
				
				<p>Each district will have a unique scale and character suited to its function and existing or potential assets, development pattern, and building styles. For example, the McNichols corridor will leverage its institutional assets, including the University of Detroit-Mercy, Marygrove College, Sinai-Grace Hospital, and Wayne County Community College, to expand Eds and Meds employment opportunities, attract employees to live in the area, and improve a diverse range of neighborhoods abutting the corridor from the historic University District to the creation of new multi-family apartment buildings directly fronting McNichols and Palmer Park.</p>

				<h5><a name="2"></a>2. A city connecting people to opportunity</h5>

				<p>A new network of transportation corridors will connect employment centers to neighborhood districts, allow for new bicycle routes and bus rapid transit corridors, reinforce economic and neighborhood centers, and provide a range of infrastructural services in sustainable natural landscapes that filter stormwater (blue infrastructure) and clean the air of transportation and industrial emissions (green infrastructure). existing proposals for enhanced transportation systems in Detroit can be modified to create a transformed network that connects people to jobs and services within the city and to employment centers beyond the city limits. The transformed network needs to respond to today&apos;s metropolitan region while actively contributing to the planned growth of employment districts and localized needs within the city. The key principle behind the transformation is the creation of a clear hierarchy of corridors, ranging from high-capacity and high- speed arterials and highways to intermediate thoroughfares, and lower-capacity neighborhood strips with frequent stopping services. Transportation networks will be conceived in concert with planning for retail amenities and services at the regional and residential scale, with neighborhood-level transportation routes designed as &ldquo;complete streets that allow bicycling, walking, and a broader range of approaches to getting places.</p>
				
				<p>Efficient movement of goods and waste in and through Detroit is key to the economic and environmental health of the city. For freight as well as personal transit, the interchanges between hierarchy tiers or different modes of transportation are as important as the routes that run between them. The type of interchange required will have an important impact on the land use in that area. A transit interchange will offer a range of higher-density land uses that can offer services to those passing through. A freight interchange may require large amounts of space and therefore should be considered for areas expected to stabilize at lower residential densities or even change land use altogether.</p>

				<h5><a name="3"></a>3. A green city where landscapes contribute to health</h5>

				<p>Unlike other cities pressed to find space for transformative landscapes, Detroit has an abundance of available land resources that can be leveraged to create a new green and sustainable city unlike any other in the world. <strong>Landscape has enormous potential to structure or foster social and cultural relationships through adapted and productive ecologies that will give rise to a new urban form.</strong></p>

				<p>Landscapes are inevitable: If you do nothing else, landscape will re-establish itself even in the most built-up areas. Relative to other forms of infrastructural or urban development, then, landscape strategies are very affordable. Landscapes also adapt well to different conditions, so they can require different types and lower intensities of maintenance to sustain them.</p>

				<p>Landscapes are productive and multi-functional. They clean air and water and soil; they make urban environments healthier; and they generate food, jobs, energy, commerce, and habitat. In this way, they cultivate new kinds of urban landscapes and experiences. They are also effective grounds for research and experimentation. New ideas can be safely and effectively tested in landscape settings for later application across the city and in other cities like Detroit.</p>

				<p>Landscapes are the original &ldquo;green&rdquo; land use: they can reduce the resources necessary to sustain the city. Landscapes enrich communities by improving the health of the environment and of the people in it, and also create a lush, rich image and identity for the city—one which competing cities would love to have.</p>

				<p>Because they work most effectively across large scales, with the ability to connect and coordinate seemingly unrelated entities, landscapes also have the potential to reconnect Detroit with its regional context. Landscapes of this type are already in place in Detroit, including the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor, Detroit RiverWalk, and Belle Isle.</p>

				<h5><a name="4"></a>4. A city of distinct, attractive neighborhoods</h5>

				<p>Detroit has room to offer many neighborhood types and lifestyle choices for residents who want to stay in the city, while welcoming new residents looking to make detroit their home. To achieve this, a series of traditional and innovative neighborhood typologies have been established to directly engage existing challenges within the city, and to leverage the strengths and assets of existing neighborhoods and places with unique characteristics. Guiding the development of these neighborhoods are a series of development targets and performance measures to define neighborhood goals and measure their success in meeting those goals—which are in turn tied to the goal of a high quality of life for all residents.</p>

				<p>While Detroit&apos;s traditional neighborhoods offer a compelling starting point for this transformation, many other areas—some of which are not necessarily recognized as viable neighborhoods today—offer a significant long-term opportunity for Detroit to be a leader in establishing a new urban form.</p>

				<p>For Detroit, this new urban form includes areas in which vacant and underutilized land and defunct industrial building stock provide the material for innovative residential environments. Green residential and green mixed-rise neighborhoods transform existing land vacancy into integrated landscapes, providing recreational, ecological, and productive functions. Mixed-use neighborhoods for living and making not only transform parts of Detroit&apos;s unutilized industrial and residential areas, they also capitalize on Detroit&apos;s production philosophy, where ideas are developed, and become real.</p>

			<h4>Strategies and Actions</h4>

				<h5><a name="a"></a>A. Create a citywide framework for growth and investment</h5>

				<p>The public, private, and philanthropic sectors need a tool to assess the city&apos;s land use conditions and 104 develop strategic approaches to investments that will improve quality of life across all parts of the city. Based on comprehensive research and analysis of the physical and market conditions of the city, the Framework Zones map will help assesses the condition of Detroit&apos;s districts and neighborhoods in terms of degrees of vacancy, from low to moderate to high. From this fact-based mapping, decision makers from city leaders to neighborhood organizations have the ability to take a more strategic approach to the opportunities and challenges facing neighborhoods, and to place those challenges in the context of the city at large. The discussion of vacancies in this broad, citywide context does not attribute &ldquo;strength&rdquo; or &ldquo;weakness&rdquo; to neighborhoods only on the basis of vacancy: Every neighborhood within the city is at risk, and every effort needs to be made to stabilize and transform the existing conditions to improve quality of life in all parts of the city.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Establish framework zones and future land use maps as the basis for public, private, and philanthropic investment.</li>
						<li>Base land use decisions on the fundamental physical and market conditions of the city: low-vacancy, moderate-vacancy, high- vacancy and Greater Downtown areas.</li>
						<li>Update framework zones map on a 5-year basis to reflect changes to physical and market conditions.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5><a name="b"></a>B. Support a network of new and existing neighborhood types</h5>

				<p><strong>The Detroit strategic framework introduces a new set of land use typologies that combine to represent the future land use vision for the city, from traditional forms that now characterize detroit to entirely new departures.</strong> These are organized in three major categories: Neighborhoods, Industry, and Landscape. Each typology is scaled to the district or neighborhood level, and includes a range of strategic interventions and development types to support the larger vision for Detroit&apos;s new form. In addition to more conventional land use typologies, such as Traditional Residential Neighborhoods or General Industrial Districts, the Detroit Strategic Framework introduces new typologies that repurpose vacant land or obsolete industrial areas for innovative or productive uses, such as Innovation Ecological landscapes and Live+Make districts.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

						<li>Establish land use typologies as the vision for the future city.</li>
						<li>Reorganize land use around neighborhoods, industry, and landscape.</li>


				<h5><a name="c"></a>C. Introduce new forms of development</h5>

				<p><strong>Areas of high, moderate, and low-vacancy all hold the potential to be assets in the reinvention of the city.</strong> As part of the land use vision, the Detroit Strategic Framework posits two key points regarding development: First, not all development can occur in all places; and second, new forms of development can affirm the city&apos;s assets and address existing physical conditions. New residential and commercial development must reinforce areas of strength and increase densities there. At the same time, areas with significant population loss and high degrees of vacancy can be the sites of new, innovative, and productive development types that improve quality of life for city residents.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>

					<ol>
						<li>Align framework zones and future land use typologies to determine appropriate locations and types of development across the city.</li>
						<li>Introduce new and innovative landscape- based development types.</li>
						<li>Introduce form-based development criteria.</li>
					</ol>

				<h5><a name="d"></a>D. Create a new and diverse open space system for the city</h5>

				<p><strong>Landscape, open space, and environmental systems are envisioned as a new, healthy, green, and productive structure for the city of Detroit.</strong> Large-scale ecological and productive landscapes will take the place of vacant lots, and begin their work cleansing the water, the air, and the soil, all the while putting people to work. They also become a center for improving public health, sustaining Detroit&apos;s rich mix of cultures, and strengthening social connections in neighborhoods and across the city.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Implement blue and green infrastructure.</li>
						<li>Encourage reuse of vacant land with productive landscapes.</li>
						<li>Diversify park network.</li>
						<li>Encourage partnerships between universities and firms in productive landscapes to conduct research and provide job training opportunities.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5><a name="e"></a>E. Redefine corridors and create complete streets</h5>

				<p>Similar to its residential land, Detroit&apos;s commercial and transportation corridors have seen massive disinvestment over the last 50 years. The city&apos;s reduced population has left its roadways oversized for the population they serve. The space left behind holds the potential for rethinking the city&apos;s corridors. In fact, we cannot afford to continue to think of transportation and other city systems as &ldquo;mono- functional&rdquo;—Detroit has the opportunity and the imperative to combine many services and functions in repurposed corridors that can accommodate different types of transit, bicycling, and walking. Doing so will create a network of &ldquo;complete streets&rdquo; that offer an efficient set of transportation options and also address the need for green space and high-quality street design. Excess space within the right-of-way can accommodate blue infrastructure such as swales to collect stormwater run-off. Within areas of low-vacancy, land can be assembled in nodes to create walkable retail districts or new residential development that reinforces adjacent neighborhoods.</p>	

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Develop tiered transit network that ties into regional system.</li>
						<li>Incorporate multi-modal transit design into all street improvements.</li>
						<li>Focus commercial development in walkable nodes or auto-oriented strips based on physical/market conditions and future land use vision.</li>
						<li>Implement green infrastructure along highway corridors.</li>
						<li>Implement blue infrastructure along arterial and other roads.</li>
					</ol>


				<h5><a name="f"></a>F. Enact innovative regulatory reform</h5>

				<p>The overlay of Framework Zones, land use typologies, and development types provide the basis for a revised regulatory framework that the City of Detroit should formally adopt. The City&apos;s anticipated adoption and codification of the Detroit Strategic Framework will also call for multiple layers of policy guidance documents within City departments and other public agencies, so that they can align implementation with the citywide vision for Detroit&apos;s new image. The Detroit Strategic Framework also offers an important opportunity to  provide a fully coordinated basis for regional and state decision making about land use and public investment, recognizing the importance of the city within a larger regional, state and national context.</p>

					<h6>Implementation actions</h6>
					<ol>
						<li>Phase land use vision over 3 horizons (stabilize/improve, sustain, transform).</li>
						<li>Revise/amend City Master Plan of Policies and Zoning Ordinance.</li>
						<li>Update public, private, and philanthropic policy guiding documents.</li>
					</ol>
